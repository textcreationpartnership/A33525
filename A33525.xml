            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:46945:4"/> ſo come to have fallen out with the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier matters of God, ſo as to be at ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances from them in their Spirits. If they had faithfully repayred to the Lord for his counſel, their ears and hearts had not been ſo open to Satanicall whiſperings. How much was that man of God in prayer to be kept ſound in the faith? witneſſe his frequent requeſts this way mentioned, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 10. <hi>O let me not wander from thy commandments:</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 29. <hi>remove from me the way of lying,</hi> (doctrinally, as well as practically conſidered) <hi>and grant me thy law graciouſly.</hi> Ve. 43. <hi>Take not away utterly the word of truth out of my mouth, ſo ſhall I keep thy law continually.</hi> Ver. 66. <hi>Teach me good judgement and knowledge, for I have believed thy commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Ver. 80. <hi>Make my heart ſound in thy Statutes, that I be not aſhamed.</hi> The corrupt prophets and prieſts of old, who ſeduced the people from the truth, were perſons that made no conſcience of prayer. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 21. <hi>The Paſtours are become brutiſh and have not ſought the Lord.</hi> Thoſe Apoſtatizing Newters in Religion of old, they were men that were
<pb facs="tcp:46945:4"/> careleſs of ſeeking of God, and counſelling with him in their prayers. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>And them that are turned back, and thoſe that have not ſought the Lord, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for him.</hi> The like may be wel feared in Chriſtians in theſe Apoſtatizing times from the truths and wayes of God, that they doe not talk much with God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and hee as little delighteth to ſpeak to their hearts. They grow looſe-hearted, and ſtrangers to God; and Satan eſpying this distance betwixt them and God, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in with them, entereth other deluſive diſcourſes with them, and at length with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth them yet further from the Lord. But thou, Christian Reader, plye it with the Lord in prayer, that hee would draw thee after him, and he will bring thee into his Chambers, <hi>Cantic.</hi> 1. 4. Hee will bring thee into the ſecret of his Counſels, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and protection, where thou ſhalt hee kept ſafe in judgement, heart and life, in the worſt times. Fervent and faithfull prayers would alſo help very much to caſt out the uncleane ſpirit out of the land, and to diſpoſſeſſe the ſpirits of many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who are even poſſeſſed by an erring ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. If there were alſo but more men of
<pb facs="tcp:46945:5"/> God, who might, <hi>Moſes</hi> like, continue holding up their hands in prayer, no doubt but <hi>Amalakite</hi> ſpirited ſeducers would ſoone be put to the worſe; yea, though Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtine-like, they had even routed the Churches of Chriſt, yet a few ſuch bleſſed worthies of God, who are mighty with God in prayer, would like ſo many <hi>Shammahs</hi> or <hi>Eleazers,</hi> ſoon prevail for a bleſſed day over them. If <hi>Jonathan</hi> had not wrought with God (in Prayer) 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 45. <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> had never had ſo glorious a day, as they had againſt tboſe <hi>Philiſtins.</hi> If men had even given themſelves to the Divel, as too many now have to ſpirits of Error, yet if <hi>Luther-like,</hi> we were more in prayer, there might be help that way, and they reſcued, and thoſe Spirits diſcarded. And what gracious heart can bear it, to ſee ſo many poor Chriſtians e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven drawn to death, and forbear crying to the Lord for their deliverance! My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> devoted to ruin, haſtneth to its downfal, and ſhall not we be up, and doing in prayer now to help diſpatch her, as they of old did that other <hi>Babylon? Jerem.</hi> 51. 35. <hi>The violence done to me be upon Babylon, ſhall the Inhabitants</hi>

Let them tremble to think, that what ever breaches they have occaſioned amongſt the Lords people, yet that there is a conſiderable ſtand of reſolute ones left, right bred <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> notable good wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and as ſpecial prevailers with God. I believe that the Churches enemies, the Prelates, and others of <hi>Englands</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to their Civil State, have been forced to ſee or feel the force of Saints Prayers. We may ſet God to work, (pardon the expreſsion) in theſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous times to Church and Commonwealth
<pb facs="tcp:46945:6"/> by our Prayers; as hee did of old in like caſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 126. <hi>It is time for thee, Lord, to work; for they make void thy Law.</hi>

            <p>Wherefore, Chriſtian Reader, albeit others have written worthily about this Subject of Prayer in their times, yet let it not ſeem unſeaſonable to thee, or bee unaccepted by thee, that I alſo (though the moſt unfit and unworthy to attempt ſo great a work) do at this time likewiſe, bring in Evidence with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Witneſſes to the ſame Truth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Nature, Neceſsity, Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and Efficacy of holy and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Prayer; and that I alſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſmall meaſure of Light and Grace received of the Lord, doe hereby endeavour to ſtir up thy pure mind by way of Remembrance, that thou mayeſt bee mindfull, not alone <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</note> of their Writings, but eſpecially of the words before ſpoken, both by the Prophets and Apoſtles concerning this Subject of Prayer; that as in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it here, the Lord was pleaſed to bleſſe that Diſcourſe of Prayer to

                  <p>Prayer is a duty very many wayes eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and honoured of God and his people; and as that which is of large uſe and extent, whoſe worth is not knowne nor eaſily decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered; whoſe nature is not readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or deſcribed, and yet that which ſhould be moſt familiar to the Saints; it is ſet forth in Scripture by many names: Let us then read over the Titles of this royal work.</p>
                  <p>It is called an <hi>Offering:</hi> Zeph. 3. 10. <hi>My</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Prayer an Offering.</note>

All the Subjects of Chriſts Kingdome muſt <hi>bring an Offering</hi> (Mincah) <hi>into the Courts,</hi> Mal. 1. 11 The converted Gentiles will bring an Offering (or <hi>Mincah)</hi> to the Lord; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſpecially this holy Offering of Prayer, which as that of old, 1.

                  <p>Prayer is called <hi>Incenſe.</hi> Pſal. 141. 2. <hi>Let</hi>

                  <p>Prayer is called a <hi>lifting up of the ſoul</hi> and <note place="margin">3 Prayer a lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of the heart and ſoul to God.</note> of the heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 1. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my ſoul;</hi> i. e. to thee do I pray. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 4. and 143. 8. The work of Prayer being not ſo much to lift up eyes, and hands, and voice, as to lift up the heart and ſoul; and as if we had not prayed, when our ſpirits were not elevated. Surely that work whereby the ſouls of Gods Suppliants, when ſinking, when cleaving to the duſt, are raiſed up, is a great work; yet <hi>Hannahs</hi> Prayer did it, <hi>She looked no more ſad,</hi> 1 Sam. 1. 15, 18. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The like lift was <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer to him, in that ſad plight, from under thoſe grievous weights upon his ſpirit. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 8. yea, hereby Gods Suppliants do get above worldly cares, fears and diſtractions. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4 6, 7. <hi>Be careful for nothing</hi> (meaning inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately) <hi>but in every thing make your requeſt known by Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the peace of God</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall keep your hearts and minds.</hi> The work of Prayer is not to move or remove God, he is in one mind, he is ſtill the ſame; but to move and remove our hearts neer to the Lord; and then have we prayed to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when by Prayer our hearts and ſpirits are in a more ſublime and celeſtial frame; when we are more above natural, carnal, and formal ſelf; when more off and above the world, and all the incouragements and diſcouragements of it; when in and by Prayer we have recovered, yea, haply ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46945:11"/> our former lively apprehenſions of, and affectious to the Lord Jeſus, our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtrength and bent of ſpirit to his favour and wayes, &amp;c. For then our hearts are indeed lifted up: yea, prayer is not only a lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of the heart <hi>effectivè,</hi> becauſe when duly performed it doth thus lift it up, but it is ſo <hi>formalitèr,</hi> becauſe the very forme, nature and eſſence of a ſpiritual prayer ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and conſiſteth in the heavenly movings, workings, and approvings of the mind and heart, as ſpiritual toward God and Chriſt, in the ſeveral expreſſions of their deſires. Gracious ſuppliants, as ſuch, they <hi>mount up with wings as Eagles,</hi> Eſay. 40. 31. They approach to the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 21. Draw near to the Lord, <hi>Pſal</hi> 73. 28. They flye to heaven for refuge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. They flie to the Lord for refuge. <hi>David,</hi> who in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. 8. pleadeth for favour and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe hee lifted up his ſoul to the Lord, in the 9th. verſe reneweth his plea in this expreſſion, becauſe he did <hi>flye to the Lord to hide him.</hi>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46945:14"/> his command is ready to attend, a buſineſſe to be done with all his might, hee loveth to make ſomething of it before he leaveth it; if he ſeemes ſometimes to idle out his time in diſtractions and diſtempers, how greivous is it to ſuch an one to ſeeme to have loſt ſuch a morning or evening with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any thing of moment for the Lord, for his owne ſoul or others?

                  <p> Prayer in the manner of carrying it on, is an holy ſerving of the Lord: how awful is a ſuppliant! hee ſerveth <hi>the Lord with feare and trembling,</hi> whileſt praying: how humble is he he is carefull to keep his diſtance even in talking thus with the Lord, Gen. 18. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> then telleth the Lord he is but <hi>duſt.</hi> Prayer alſo in the intents and deſires of the ſuppliant it is ſerving the Lord, all that which a true ſuppliant fetcheth of God in Prayer, if you reſolve it into its laſt end, it is ſervice. He prayeth for outward things as <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 28. For parts and gifts, as <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 King. 3. For life and health, for deliverance out of divers afflictions, outward and inward, as <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Eſay. 38. and <hi>David</hi> oft; but in all, it is that he might ſerve the Lord, and glorfie him the more thereby; he cometh with a ſervantly ſpirit, for mercy from God, ready preſſed to doe any work of his, to attend any command of his, Pſal. 123. 1, 2.

True ſuppliants eye the Lord as a great God, as well as gracious, and therefore are willing to keep their due diſtances: though the Saints be the friends of Chriſt and of God, who may make in a holy wiſe bold with him, yet it is holy manners to them not rudely to preſſe upon his favour, or challenge this or that benefit of it without asking leave. Indeed pinching extremities will make them put a good face upon it, and not continue walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and againe aloof off, within ſome general veiw of mercy, but to knock, and knock again and again at mercyes doore, to pray often for the opening thereof to them. True ſuppliants are in haſte, of earneſt and weighty affairs in their converſes with the Lord, they have much to do with him, much to ſay to him, much to receive from him, and therefore they muſt, they will knock; they

But in as much as in handling the particular kinds of prayer, wee have more occaſion to preſſe upon the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we ſhall here but name ſuch things as might inforce to the duty.</p>
                  <p>Let us onely now make one uſe of what <note place="margin">
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſ.</hi> Reproving neglect of prayer.</note> hath been ſaid, and that in way of reproofe of Gods owne profeſsing people, who are too ready alſo, to neglect and omit this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of prayer, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 43. 21, 23. <hi>But thou haſt not called upon me, O Jacob;</hi> that was very greivous to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when a people whom he hath ſevered into Church eſtate, with an aime at his praiſe, as verſe 21. yet they ſhould neglect to honour him in conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable calling upon him. Such as we are, are looked upon by others as a praying people, but ah, that the world were not miſtaken in us: what wonder is it if many profeſſors excell no more in the things of God, if they are not much in prayer! One of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents uſed to ſay, if I ſee a man not delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in prayer, I conclude he is one of no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward excellencies; nay; is it any wonder to ſee many Congregations, rather Spitals of poor decrepit, decaied, diſeaſed Chriſtians, then gardens, where are goodly fragrant thriving plants? As the body without the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46945:22"/> ſoul is dead, unſerviceable, yea ſtinketh in others noſtrills, ſo are we as loathſome in Gods ſight, without the true exerciſe of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which (as ſome have called it) is (as it were) the ſoule of our ſoules: ſome of the Ancients have called prayer the phyſick of the ſoule; and truely ſuch it is, it will by the bleſsing of God, purge, heale, recover. quicken and ſtrengthen a very weakly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as experience witneſſeth. But what will become of other diſtempered, relapſed profeſſours, who uſe not this holy courſe of phyſick, is it wonder that ſuch dye, become twice dead? Some have called praier the ſun and light of the ſoule, and truely in a ſenſe it is ſo, but how darkely and ſadly muſt they needs walk, and how often will they be ſtumbling and falling dangerouſly? How little ſpirituall work will they do for Chriſt, in whoſe Horiſon this ſun of prayer is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, if not already ſet, and from whom this lightſome and life-giving ordinance is removed? Others have called prayer the nerves and ſinews of the ſoule, and truely ſo it is; prayer holdeth altogether in us, keepeth all in due place and ſtrength; and they muſt needs grow looſe and weak, who make not continual uſe thereof upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. But that this admonition bee not as an arrow ſhot at Rovers, let us ſhew firſt ſome ſymptomes of this ſpiritual evill of omiſsion of prayer: and ſo who are the perſons concerned herein, and ſhew ſome

                  <p>HAving ſpoken of Prayer in general, we come now to ſpeak of the ſpecies and ſorts of Prayer: and therein firſt of ſudden or Ejaculatory Prayer, In reſpect of which, we may be ſaid to pray, and muſt alſo pray <hi>without ceaſing.</hi> He who enjoyneth us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely to pray without ceaſing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us alſo to pray in an ejaculatory way, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Pray with all Prayer,</hi> or all manner of Prayer, and ſo this alſo. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaculatory prayer is either mental only, or vocal alſo.</p>
                  <p>Ejaculatory prayer <hi>Mental</hi> is a ſhort, yet ſerious and ſincere lifting up of the hearts
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46945:24"/> deſires and ailes unto the Lord; the mind (as it were) inwardly uttering the ſame to him. Thus <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> cryed to the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. 31. And thus <hi>Samſon</hi> called upon the Lord, and ſaid, (in Gods hearing, not in the lads hearing that led him) <hi>O Lord God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 28. Thus <hi>Nehemiah chap.</hi> 2. 4, 5. praied unto the God of Heaven, yet the King then preſent, neither heareth a whiſper, nor ſeeth any motion of his lips, whilſt <hi>Nehemiah</hi> is thus ſpeaking a word or two of moment to the King of Kings. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his mental ſpeaking to God, was a loud cry in the Lords ears; he ſpake nothing vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, yet <hi>Exod.</hi> 14: 15. <hi>Why cryeſt thou,</hi> ſaith the Lord? Believers are to God through Chriſt a ſpiritual Temple and houſe, that within this houſe alſo, in the innermoſt part thereof, this holy incenſe of Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Prayer may be offered to the Lord with acceptance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Ejaculatory Prayer vocal, is a holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtrophe, or turning ones ſpeech to God <note place="margin">Ejaculatory Prayer deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> prayer-wiſe, in ſome ſhort, yet pithy expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from what a gracious perſon is think. ing, ſaying, doing, or ſuffering. Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> breaks off his continued ſpeech in bleſſing his ſons, turning himſelf to God, <hi>O Lord, I have waited for thy ſalvation,</hi> Gen. 49. 18. So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> from threatning the <hi>Aſſyrians, Iſai.</hi> 33. 1. turneth prayer-wiſe to God, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>O Lord be merciful unto us.</hi> So <hi>Micah</hi> in like ſort, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 13, 14. <hi>Feed thy people with</hi>

                     <hi>thy rod.</hi> Thus Chriſt breaketh off his ſpeech to his Diſciples, and turneth it to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>John</hi> 12. 26, 27, 28. <hi>Father glorifie thy name, &amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 40, 41, 42. From reproving his fellow doth the penitent Thief turn his ſpeech to Chriſt, <hi>Lord remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me in thy Kingdom.</hi> Thus <hi>Nehemiah</hi> amidſt his reforming work, oftentimes tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him to God thus, <hi>Remember me, O my God concerning this, &amp;c</hi> Nehem. 13. 13, 14, 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>Let us now ſpeak a little of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency <note place="margin">The excellency of Ejaculatory Prayer</note> and neceſſity of the duty of praying without ceaſing in an ejaculatory way, give Reaſons for it and apply it.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46945:25"/> ſome ſpiritual excellency inſtamped upon them; and theſe words are ſuch like Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. If it were poſſible to hear the laſt whiſpers of the Saints ſouls, as ready to leave their bodies, they would be found to be ſuch like breathings of their deſire to him to whom they are going. Ejaculatory Prayer alſo is the firſt and laſt of ſet and ſolemne <note place="margin">It is the α and ω of Solemn Prayer.</note> Prayer, when rightly performed.

The laſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of Solemn prayer, is iſſued in an Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, an Ejaculatory Amen, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the cloſing deſires, and feeling motions of faith to all before pleaded for. All the prayers of a gracious Suppliant are not end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his continued ſpeech in prayer; no, his heart is lifting and lifting; as you ſee a bel-rope oft hoiſing up after you have done ringing the bell. Many a long look and heart wiſh followeth ſuch an ones deſire to heaven, and all together come before the Lord for mercy. Hence the Lord, as hee is <hi>nigh to them that call upon him,</hi> ſo he <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filleth the deſires of them that fear him,</hi> Pſal. 145. 18, 19. <hi>Solomons</hi> heart was as well left

                  <p>Let us add another infallible Argument of the excellency of this duty, of ejaculato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <note place="margin">Its of choice reſpect with God.</note> praier, and that is from the high eſteem and real reſpects which God himſelfe hath expreſſed thereof. <hi>Habbacucks</hi> diſcourſe, chap. 3. though moſt what doctrinal, and onely ſomething mentioned in a ſhort way
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46945:28"/> of petition, verſe 2. and of praiſing God. verſe 18, 19. yet as from the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent part in Gods account, it is all called his prayer, ver. 1. The penitent thiefs ejaculation, <hi>Lord remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdome,</hi> is graciouſly ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and anſwered by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe, Luk.</hi> 23. 41, 42. The Publican ejaculatorily pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Lord be mercifull to me a ſinner,</hi> goeth away juſtified, <hi>Luk</hi> 18. 13, 14. yea that eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatory <hi>Apoſtrophe</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> to God, <hi>Ex.</hi> 5. end, <hi>Why haſt thou ſo evilly intreated the people?</hi> yet hath its gracious returne from the Lord, chap. 6. 1. Then ſaid the Lord, <hi>Now ſhalt thou ſee what I will do to Pharoah.</hi> The Iſraelites at the red ſea were ſo afraid with a diſtruſtfull fear, that <hi>Moſes</hi> bids them not to feare, <hi>Exod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 14 13. yet being thus afraid, they cryed unto the Lord, verſe 10. 12. and both <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> chap. 9. 9. and <hi>Joſhua.</hi> chap. 24. 7. teſtifieth, that God heard that crie of theirs, and put darkneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and the Egyptians, and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Egyptians in the red ſea. <hi>David</hi> when in ſuch a hurry of diſtruſt, that he ſaid to God, <hi>I am cut off from thy ſight,</hi> yet ſaith, <hi>nevertheleſſe thou heardeſt the voyce of my ſupplications,</hi> (Pſal. 31. 22.) the many ſhort prayers which he then made. Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are but ſhort breathings of the Saints ſpirits, but being breathed once, they ſcarce ever expire in reſpect of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46945:28"/> efficacies and iſſues of them. Theſe ſhort ſpeeches are (as I may ſay) beſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, their memorials are of a very long date with the Lord. That grey-headed ejaculation of <hi>Noah, God perſwade Japhet to dwell in the tents of Shem,</hi> hath had, now hath, and ſtill will have its anſwer, in the Gentiles, of <hi>Japhets</hi> coming into the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Church. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 27.

At that day when the Saints treaſures layd up in heaven ſhall bee opened, theſe leſſer peices ſhall have their weight, worth and uſe, when it ſhall bee ſaid, theſe and theſe have been the prayers of ſuch and ſuch of the Saints, and theſe and theſe are the iſſues and fruits of them to ſuch and ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Thus much touching the excellency of <note place="margin">The neceſſity of ejaculatory prayer by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Sudden ſtraits.</note> ſuch ejaculations: now of the neceſſity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

Let us now briefly add a Reaſon or two yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to enforce this duty.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is taken from the nature and property of this duty, which honoureth the Lord in a ſpecial manner, as a glorious <note place="margin">In his immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience.</note> Spirit, which needeth not any words of ours to expreſs what we would to him. He can hear the holy language and ſpeech of our ſpirits; he underſtandeth the meaning of ſighes not to be expreſſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaculatory Prayer proclaimeth the Lord, that he is not as the Idol Gods, who need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to be awakened by loud out-cryes, as 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 27, as <hi>Elijah</hi> derided <hi>Baals</hi>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:46945:31"/> Prieſts, wiſheth them to <hi>cry aloud, &amp;c.</hi> Who needeth not to be carryed up and down as dunghil Gods do, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 5. No, this proclaimeth to all the world, that the God of the Saints is an all-ſeeing God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpying the leaſt moving of their deſires to him; that he is in all, and through all, and filleth every place; yea, that he is a very preſent help at any dead lift; that he is a God hearing Prayers, all ſorts of Prayers, the ſhorteſt of them. If <hi>Ephraim</hi> but liſp and wiſper out, <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned, &amp;c.</hi> God ſaith, <hi>I have ſurely heard him;</hi> Jer. 31. 18, 19, 20. If <hi>Iſrael</hi> take unto them words prayer-wiſe, though but ſhort, <hi>Take away all iniquity, and receive us graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, &amp;c.</hi> God can, and will ſay. <hi>I have ſurely heard him and obſerved him,</hi> Hoſ. 14. 1, 2, 3, 8. This glorifieth him, as one who aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly waites to be gracious, that any ſuch cry and whiſper as this is of the Saints, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by him, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30. 18. <hi>The Lord waits to be gracious;</hi> and ver. 19, is a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, <hi>The Lord will be very gracious at the voice of thy cry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon is taken from the precious fruits of the conſcionable exerciſe <note place="margin">2 From the Fruits of it. Its a means</note> of this duty; of ſuch ſudden and ſhort lifts of the heart to the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a very ſpecial means to keep our <note place="margin">1 To keep us Spiritual.</note> hearts very Spiritual, and ſavoury, when ſo often in heaven, taking ſome ſhort turnes with God and Jeſus Chriſt. When ſo oft
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46945:32"/> with God, diſtances will not ſo eaſily grow when converſing ſo with God, there is more of his brightneſs, more of his Image upon ſuch an ones face and heart. When gracious perſons are ever and anon making ſuch holy ſtands and pawſes of ſpirit (leſt being let go too long, and at too large a teather, they grow unſavoury) they are kept cloſer with God. Take two Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, the one careleſs in this, the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable in attending to it. Alas, what ſad ruſhes, bruiſes, and falls upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhadow of a temptation? if he get ſome kind of hold of a Promiſe. this ſword of the Spirit hangs looſe and dangling (as it were) like <hi>Amaſa's</hi> ſword, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 8. yea, all the reſt of his Spiritual armor, is anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yea, but the other keepeth himſelf that the <hi>evil one toucheth him not;</hi> enters not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to temptation: He hath Goſpel Promiſes made known, and made over to him to uſe at any time, he hath them by him, he keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a holy edg upon them, by which he cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth aſunder many temptations: He hath his faith and hope in its ſtrength; his <hi>bow abides in his ſtrength, and his armes are not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> Gen. 48. If temptations to unrighteous or guileful dealings begirt him, his heart cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out, God forbid, O Lord, how dare I ſo ſin againſt thee! If foiled at any time, he preſently cryeth, O Lord, ah my vile heart, Lord, Lord help: or if unexpected afflictions be ordered to him, he hereby ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46945:32"/> his ſhooes of Peace ever and anon cloſer, Patience (Lord) do me good hereby; and ſo is not galled or grieved, as the other when meeting with ſuch ſtubby and hard wayes. <hi>Paul</hi> was much that way with God, learned contentment in all conditions; knew how to be full, and how to be hungry, to abound and to want, and to glory in infirmities.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is a ſpecial means to fit us for more ſolemne and continued Prayer. They <note place="margin">2 To ſit us for ſolemn Praier</note> are ever good Proficients in that holy Art of Pleading, they are ever and anon thus plodding upon it; their minds thus exerciſed in it upon all occaſions. Such as wil be ever and anon thus whetting their praying ſpirits and graces, will make work of it when they come to it. They that are good at theſe running pulls and trips, are ſurely good wreſtlers with God. It is no new or ſtrange work to ſuch to pray, that when they come to pray more ſolemnly they know not how to ſet about it; their hearts are not ſo out of kilter (as we ſay) as it is with idle Profeſſors: No, theſe that have been ſo oft in a day at work with God this way, have not their Tooles to ſeek, but at hand, and all in good plight, fit for uſe. Praying thoughts and deſires are in a holy readineſſe, they familiarize with them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a meanes to meet oft with God. <note place="margin">3 To meet oft with God.</note> If <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant be thus walking with God in his journey, God will be with him, he will meet him. No ſooner hath he done
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46945:33"/> ſpeaking to God in his heart, but he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth that God is with him, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly bleſſeth him, that <hi>being in the way he led him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 12, 27, 45, 47. God is oft with the Miniſter in his Study, who is thus praying oft in his heart for good ſpeed in his work; oft with the labouring man in the field, whilſt at his work, if thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſpiritually.</p>

But for the faſtning of this exhortation, and the right managing of the duty exhorted unto, let us lay down, 1. Some motives to it. 2.

                  <p n="1">1. That this precept and duty injoyned <note place="margin">1. Its well for the Saints, that God requireth and owneth this duty.</note> of God, is a very precious priviledge to the Saints; they of all others may well be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to this duty: in that it is well for them that ejaculatory prayer is acceptable prayer, a choice ſervice which the Lord himſelfe appointeth and delighteth in: it is well for us, brethren and ſiſters, that we may thus ſpeak and converſe with our God, when none either thinketh or knoweth of it; wee may ever and anon talke thus with our heavenly and gracious Soveraigne, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46945:36"/> others in our very company, neither heare, nor mark it, As <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did in the kings preſence, he prayed to the Lord of heaven, and the king not privy to it, <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> 2. 4. As we walke in the way with others, wee may exchange a few of theſe holy ſpeeches, and yet keep our way and diſcourſe with them; little doe carnall perſons think how many of theſe holy lifts ſometimes gracious and ſpiritual perſons (occaſionally caſt into their company) have, whileſt they are with them. It is meat and drink which they know not of, communing with one that is inviſible. They may have ſweet anſwers and returnes alſo thereof, which fill their hearts with heavenly joy, wherewith a ſtranger doth not intermeddle. Yea, in their ſleep, the Saints may thus bee talking with God, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 9. it was in a dreame when God ſaid unto <hi>Solomon, ask what I ſhall give thce,</hi> verſe 5. and he did ſo, verſe 15. <hi>and he awakened, and behold it was a dream;</hi> a ſign then, that hee was that while as in a ſleep, when praying, and yet ſo graciouſly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and anſwered, ver. 10, 11. And alas, what elſe would have become of Gods <hi>Aſahs,</hi> and <hi>Jehoſhaphats, Davids,</hi> &amp;c. of whom you heard, if this were not prevailing prayer? what ſhould deſolate <hi>Jonah</hi> in the whales belly, alſo doe? <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. 1.

                     <hi>upon the name of the Lord out of the low dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, and thou heardeſt my voice, &amp;c.</hi> Some freinds would ſometimes give a world to exchange a word or two with a choice freind of theirs in their extremity: If I could but ſend or ſpeak with ſuch a one will ſuch ſay, I need not, I ſhould not lye here thus. If my Father, if my Brother did but know of it, I am ſure they would relieve mee in my ſtraits: though I am now a Turks ſlave, yet I have ſuch and ſuch friends in ſuch a countrey which would ranſome mee, &amp;c. Yea, but the Saints need not ſay ſo, the Saints are never ſo hard put to it, but if they want opportunity more ſolemnly, yet this way they may be telling their heavenly Father, and friend Jeſus Chriſt how it is with them. And is not this well for them? yea verily. Alas, what ſhould dumb ones doe, whoſe tongues the enemy cut out, or if not, gag them, if yet there were no means left of ſpeaking with their heavenly Father? but bleſſed be God there is this way left to ſuch. It may bee malicious perſecutors will be throwing the ſaints into a Jayle. amongſt a company of rogues, which will ſcoffe at the very mention of prayer; now welfare this part of Gods revealed wil, injoyning ejaculations for prayers alſo: the poore Saints may then poure out theſe prayers to their God, in which ſuch a helliſh crue cannot well interrupt them; they may hear them ſigh, it may be, or ſee them weep; but
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46945:37"/> judge that as ariſing from other cauſes, which indeed and in truth is ſome ſigh of love, holy longing, admiration, or the like; a precious melting of faith in their hearts, amidſt theſe ſhort heart ſpeeches with the Lord. Sometimes the Saints are like <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> as well oppreſſed inwardly as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, that they cannot in a continued way pray, but onely in an abrupt and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken way, chatter, and that within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and at length get out, <hi>Lord I am op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, undertake for me:</hi> and they are like babes in Chriſt, and can but brokenly ſtammer out their mindes to the Lord, or like the Publicane, not daring in a manner to ſpeak much; but in ſhort, to beſpeak mercy as to chiefe of ſinners: is it then not well for ſuch, that <hi>O Lord bee mercifull to me a ſinner,</hi> is ſuch an acceptable prayer with God? yea verily, it is well for the Saints when to leave the world, when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they can ſpeak to be underſtood of any friend, nor their friends to them, albeit both may deſire it with their mindes and ſpirits, and have audience and acceptance; and indeed if this were not ſo acceptable a duty, many a bleſſed ſoul ſylloqui with God of the Saints living and dying, were made null and uſeleſſe. And is it not well then for the Saints that ejaculatory prayer is acceptable prayer? yea, it is very well in theſe and other reſpects: and truly, though it be as I may ſay, ill for ſome notorious

                  <p>WE have ſpoken of Ejaculatory Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; proceed we now to conſider of Solemn and continued Praier, which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Publick or Church Praier, Private or Family Prayer, Secret or Cloſet Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Begin we now with the conſideration of Publick or Church Praier, which is alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in this indefinite Precept, written to the Church of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> collective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as wel as diſtributively conſidered, 1 <hi>Theſ</hi> 1. 1.

                  <p> For our better proceeding herein, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 1. Of the requiſites to Publick Praier. 2. Of the Reaſons of it. 3. Of ſome Uſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Touching the firſt: Some things are <note place="margin">Things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of ſuch as are to pour out publick praier.</note> required to ſuch as are to bee the mouth of the Church in Praier; ſome things in ſuch as joine with them.</p>
                  <p>Of the former ſort of requiſites are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A publick Call. So it was of old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. A publick Call.</note> 21. 5. <hi>The Prieſts the ſons of Levi ſhall come neer, for them hath the Lord thy God choſen to miniſter to him, and to bleſs in the name of the Lord;</hi> which was in Prayer-wiſe, as <hi>Num</hi> 6 23, 24. <hi>&amp;c.

                  <p>Now this Call to become the peoples mouth to God, as it reſpecteth God, ſo it is (amongſt other things) Gods fitting them with abilities, as for Preaching, ſo for Prayer; and his ſequeſtring them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly thereunto, as to their work: whence that <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 4. <hi>We will give our ſelves to Praier, and to the Miniſtry of the Word:</hi> namely, as we are Miniſters, and in an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both alike are Miniſterial acts, and gifting for the one as well as for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a choice part of a Miniſterial Call.

                  </p>
                  <p>As if ſuch men by their Calling were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry full men of all Abilities for their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial works; yea, as if it were one maine part of their Call, to be that way as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete as may be.

The Elders in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles dayes called to that Office, they were gifted upon any occaſion to make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought Prayer. <hi>James</hi> 5. 14: <hi>Let them ſend for the Elders, and let them pray over him,</hi> and verſ. 16. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the inwrought <hi>Prayer of a Righteous man availeth much.</hi> Both the Officers, yea, and Members alſo of pure Churches, in the dayes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel (as thoſe four living Creatures, and twenty four Elders, graver Chriſtians) are repreſented as gifted for Prayer,<hi>—Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Vials filled with odours of Prayers,</hi> Rev. 5. 8. And ſurely, ſuch as are to be the Choſen conſtant Speakers of the Aſſembly to the Lord, they had need have choice skil in all
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46945:41"/> holy and heavenly praying-oratory: ſuch as are to be the choſen champions (as I may ſay) of the Congregation to wreſtle it out with God on their behalf, they had need have the art of holy wreſtling or prayer. Such as are the choſen Solicitours for this or that corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as they had need to bee acquainted with the people well, that they may be able to make every ones prayer, and plea, and complaint, and the like; So had they need to have the choice skil, and holy art of pleading with the Lord, as cauſe ſhall require.</p>
                  <p>This call of ſuch as are to be the officers, and more conſtant mouth of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in prayer, conſiſts in their free Election and full Approbation for that and other miniſterial work, ſome way manifeſted and expreſſed by the people, together with their owne free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereunto. Thus the Levite ſet apart of God to the miniſtry of old, and amongſt other things therein, to bleſſe in the name of the Lord; or to pray and praiſe God publickly, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 8. The Elders of the Congregation, on the congregations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe are to impoſe hands upon them, <hi>Num.</hi> 8. 9, 10. in teſtimony of their ſolemne call of them to miniſterial work. God will have no one to bee the mouth of any Church, who ſhall be a burthen, or grievous to it; he will have none forced upon it; but rather have ſuch a mouth, as the body ſhall deſire gladly thereby to breath out its requeſts
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46945:42"/> and deſires to the Lord. Nor was the Lord more tender of old of the orderly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of his publick worſhip, then he is now; then the peoples call was Gods call, he ſet the Levites apart to bleſs in his name, in their ſetting them apart for that end. And ſo it is now, publick prayer is the publick act of the Church, there ſhould then bee a publick hand in it, not onely in joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the petitions, but by ſolemne call of him, which preferreth the ſame in their names to the Court of heaven. It is of great concernement to every one in the church, as what words, and how, ſo by whom the ſame are ſpoken in the Lords ears, as their words. They who draw ſo near to the Lord to deal in Chriſts name for ſo many others, had need be approved of God for that end; and that they are not, if not approved of his people. In a word, it is no ſmall incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to ſuch ſo called, againſt all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward diſcouragements, and tentations, which they meet with in their work; that as they are in Gods way, ſo in the place, and about the work in ſpecial, to which the Lord by his people did call them.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond requiſite to him who is to <note place="margin">2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Requ. 2 Praying in the ſpirit.</note> pray as the mouth of the aſſembly, is, that he <hi>pray in the ſpirit. Eph.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>praying with all manner of prayer</hi> (and ſo with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke prayer alſo,) <hi>in the ſpirit;</hi> not alone with our hearts or ſpirits, but <hi>praying in the holy Ghoſt, Jude</hi> 20. Or by a gift, and by
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46945:42"/> the immediate help of the holy Ghoſt. Even ſuch as are to edifie others in their moſt holy faith, privately, are to pray thus; and much more ſuch as are by office to give themſelves to the miniſtry of the word. There is great danger (to ſay no worſe of it) when this tabernacle, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Church-incenſe or prayer, is of humane compoſition, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 38. And in offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſo publick a ſacrifice with fire of mans kindling, and ſuch as cometh not downe from heaven, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 1, 2. but much indeed needeth not to bee ſpoken to this, now that the Lord by his grace, hath ſo cleared up his mind to his ſervants of all ſorts in theſe dayes. Yet let mee briefly confirm this truth, and thereby the hearts alſo of the Saints in the preſent truth: pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayer muſt bee in the ſpirit, or by an immediate gift and help of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe publick prayer being part of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reaſons.</hi> It muſt be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on with moſt holy beauty.</note> publick worſhip, it ſhould bee performed with greateſt beauty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29. 2. and 96. 8.

Now the Church in her beauty, <hi>Cantic.</hi> 7. 1. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with verſe 9. <hi>The roofe of her mouth</hi> (both in prayer and preaching) <hi>is like the beſt wine, that goeth downe ſweetly, cauſing the lips of theſe which are aſleep to ſpeak.</hi> And ſurely experience ſealeth it, that there is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46945:43"/> more lively efficacy to ſuch as are preſent when prayers are put up to the Lord in the aſſembly, from the immediate help of the ſpirit, then any other way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Becauſe by ſuch manner of praier God <note place="margin">2 God is moſt honoured by it</note> hath moſt glory, (which is that, which in publick worſhip is mainely intended, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29. 2.) for he hath moſt glory of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gifts of the ſpirit, inabling Miniſters to pray thus: of his glorious wiſedome alſo, in the variety of the meaſures thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon his ſervants. Thoſe Church-officers which have their vialls full of ſuch odours, which as thoſe of old, were only of divine invention, compoſition and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they in ſpecial ſort have <hi>their harpes ſounding forth the praiſes of God, (Revel.</hi> 5. 8.) Theſe miniſterial ſtars in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, <hi>(Revel.</hi> 1. 20.) doe then in ſpecial wiſe declare the glory of God, when they ſhine, as in preaching, ſo in prayer publickly, not with borrowed light from others, but by an innate and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light, (as I may ſay) in them, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as ſpiritual, and ſpiritually gifted of the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe ſuch manner of praying in <note place="margin">3 It is the Churches perfection.</note> the ſpirit, conſiſteth beſt with the Churches perfection. The lips of ſuch a Spouſe or Church of Chriſt which is moſt fair and compleat, they <hi>drop</hi> (both in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayer and preaching) <hi>as the honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, Cantic.</hi> 4. 10, 11.

When the Church in the 45th <hi>Pſalme</hi> is (under the notion of <hi>Solomons Egyptian</hi> wife, a Gentile,) ſet forth <hi>in her glorious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,</hi> verſe 14. <hi>She is ſaid to be brought to the King</hi> (Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>in garments of needlework.</hi> The Churches garments, as they are the glorious robes of the righteouſneſſe of faith, and graces of the Spirit, (which are viſible to the Lord, though more inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to men) ſo are they the ordinances too, wherewith ſhee is (as it were) inveſted, when ſhe cometh near the Lord in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly: now ſuch Church ornaments as preaching and prayer in ſpecial, they are needlework wrought on both ſides, (as I may ſay) the inward work of the ſpirit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the gifts and graces therein exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. The outward work thereof, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expreſſions, not wrought by men to our hands, ſo much as by the ſpirit, framing and directing the ſame in publick as well as private prayer, as before was hinted from the Greek phraſe in <hi>James</hi> 5. 16. in ſinging of Pſalmes; wherein not one alone as in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and prayer, acteth in the name of God, or others, but every one inſtructeth each other perſonally. It ſufficeth that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46945:44"/> for the matter, it be the word of Chriſt the Prophet of his Church, ſpeaking the ſame, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. and for the manner of expreſſion, ſuch as by the help of a gift of the ſpirit, is expreſſed outwardly, in the words of the ſpirit (as near as may be) and uttered from ſutable workings of the ſpirit in the hearts of all inwardly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe ſuch a way of carrying on <note place="margin">4 Its moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Churches liberty.</note> publick prayer, is moſt ſutable to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches liberty, and to the ſpiritual liberty alſo of the officers of the Church, as part thereof. The Church is now no bond-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but a free-woman, and ſo are her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſharers with her in that freedom, <hi>(Gal.</hi> 4. 26. 31.) as from ceremonial injunctions, which ſometimes God ordained, ſo much more from humane inventions, which the Lord never inſtituted. The Churches mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial mouthes, have moſt bold liberty of ſpirit in ſuch conceived prayer, to receive ſuch drops of the ſpirit of prayer poured out upon the Saints, and the renewed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences thereof. Yea to improve the holy variety of ſeaſonable motions, even then made by the ſpirit interceding in them; wherein ſome particular caſes of ſundry poor ſoules preſent, haply unknowne to the Miniſters, are to the life repreſented, even as if the parties had informed them thereof. Yea they are more free to improve the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious meaſures of their gift of prayer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, which in divers Miniſters are very
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46945:44"/> various; yea they are freer to expreſſe the various ſtatures (as it were) or pitch of their reſpective Churches, being not all of one ſize, but ſome more eminent for grace then others. Yea they are freer to expreſs the various conditions and failings of their Churches, which as the Moon, are ſubject to various aſpects. <hi>(Cantic.</hi> 6. 10.) The Churches, and her Miniſters liberty, is in both alike preſerved entire, when they are left to the free uſe of all holy liberty, to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the mind and caſe of the Church to the Lord, as when left to like liberty to ſpeak and deliver the Lords minde to the Church.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

Acts</hi> 10. 2. If the reſt feared God; ſurely they prayed oft alone. But in the family <hi>Cornelius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was more conſtantly imployed as the mouth of the reſt. For indeed, every gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Maſter of a family is an <hi>holy Prieſt to God.

God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Matrons ſhould really make conſcience

                  <head>CHAP. V. Touching Cloſet Prayer.</head>
                  <p>VVE come now to the third branch of ſolemne and continued Prayer; namely Secret and Cloſet Prayer: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction reacheth, as the Church of <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica,</hi> collectively conſidered as a Church, and the families there as Chriſtian families;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46945:63"/> ſo each particular Chriſtian there perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, what hee is to do apart, as well as what he is to do as a member of the Congregation or Family; and by Analogy every other Chriſtian is bound and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this precept, to pray alone alſo, and that <hi>without ceaſing, Mat.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>But thou when thou prayeſt, enter into thy Cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut to thy door, pray to thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret, &amp;c.</hi> he ſaith not, when <hi>[you]</hi> pray, but <hi>[thou] when [thou] pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, enter into thy cloſet. &amp;c.</hi> as ſpeaking not ſo much of a joynt Duty of many toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as of a duty which each perſon is to do alone, as in the other verſe 3. <hi>When thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thine Almes, &amp;c.</hi> It is an injunction not ſo much of what the godly are to do in ſome joint way of Charity. but what each gracious perſon is to do apart and alone as occaſion is offered, even when or where none elſe haply can, or will do as they do. So <hi>Chemnitius, Cartwright, Aretius,</hi> and <hi>Muſculus</hi> upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6. they expound this of prayer in retyred places. And albeit the intent of Chriſt be not meerly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe cloſet Prayer in that Scripture as each Chriſtians proper duty, and much leſſe to preſcribe it as all the prayer which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for from his people; yet we may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, that hee therein commendeth and commandeth cloſet praier of each Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian alone by himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as one ſpecial way of praying to him, who ſeeth in ſecret, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46945:64"/> as that wherein they ſhall give a ſpecial te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their ſincerity, and avoid that vain-glorious affection of mens praiſe, which the Lord Jeſus there blameth in the Scribes and Phariſees.</p>
                  <p>Touching this Duty then, conſider we, 1. Who muſt pray thus alone. 2. Why? And 3: What uſe wee are to make thereof.</p>
                  <p>Touching the firſt, we ſay, none are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted <note place="margin">Each one muſt pray alone</note> who are of underſtanding to know what they are to do therein; whether younger or elder, high or low, rich or poor, bond or free, Male or Female, as they are all one in point of dignity and priviledg in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27, 28. as they have and profeſſe each of them an intereſt in him, who is, and ſeeth in ſecret as their Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Pray to thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret, &amp;c.</hi> Every one ſeverally apart, as well as jointly together, is to cry in ſecret alſo, <hi>Abba Father, Gal.</hi> 4. 6. the very wives apart muſt be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their ſpirit of Supplication in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and contrite manner, as well as together with their family, yea ſometimes in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner muſt they thus mourn, even pray and faſt apart; and therefore much more may they, muſt they pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritely in an ordinary way, when apart from the reſt of the Family; the wives who have ſo many occaſions more then others, from little ones, and other houſhold affairs, to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:46945:64"/> take up their time above others, yet are not exempted from this holy exerciſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by proportion none elſe are exempted from it.</p>
                  <p>Touching the ſecond. The Reaſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing <note place="margin">Reaſons why. 1 Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging it.</note> this duty, are</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Taken from the Promiſe of God, partly undertaking that it ſhall be ſo, that his people ſhall be enabled to pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part by themſelves, and ſhall exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therein, as <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10, 11, 12, 13. he promiſeth to pour upon them the ſpirit of Supplication, and that they ſhould mourne or pray in an humble and contrite manner, by themſelves alone: and partly from his promiſe to his people, when at any time thus exerciſed in ſecret prayer when none elſe ſees them, when, or how, or how long they pray, <hi>he will reward them openly,</hi> partly in this life. All ſhall ſee, and manifeſtly perceive by the fruit thereof, that <hi>Iſaak Hannah,</hi> and <hi>Zacharias</hi> did pray alone to their heavenly Father for the fruit of the womb. The Holy Ghoſt recordeth it in the Scriptures, and thereby holdeth it forth to the view of every eye to whom the Word ſhall come, how honourably God hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and rewarded ſecret praier. All ſhal ſee that <hi>Moſes</hi> is wont to be with God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone by his manifeſt and notable prevailing with God: if he but go aſide and pray to the Lord, blinded <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelfe ſhall do it, and therefore is often entreating his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46945:65"/> for him and his people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. and 9. and 10. ſo the Jewes could not but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, whence they recourſe oft to him to pray for them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 1, 2. and 21. 7, 8, 9 and the places ſhew a manifeſt reward of that his praying, granted and given out thereupon. How openly did God reward <hi>Daniel,</hi> who was wont to pray to his God in ſecret, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 10. with manifeſt deliverance from ſo great a death, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. and with the notable ruine brought upon thoſe who would have forbidden and hindred him from that holy exerciſe of his but three dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>verſe</hi> 5, 6, 7. and 10, 11, 12, 24. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. The more the Saints do thus ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo acquaint themſelves with God, the more notable good ſhall come to them, the very light of God ſhall ſhine upon the wayes of ſuch; the very Iland where they are ſhall fare the better for them. <hi>Job</hi> 22. 21, 27, 28, 30 compared. And as in this life ſo in that which is to come, will God reward them openly, when <hi>God will bring every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret work to judgment</hi> of remuneration, <hi>Eccl;</hi> 12. 14, when the <hi>Saints ſhall receive accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good they have done in the body;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. Then ſhall their ſecret ſeeking of Gods face alſo come to light. It ſhall be ſhewed before the whole world, how many, &amp; many a time, ſuch and ſuch of Gods hidden ones have been ſerving him with their ſpirits, and that they have been, and now fully are thus and thus graciouſly rewarded; not a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46945:65"/> tear of theirs ſhed in their pouring out their ſouls thus before God, but he bottled up, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 56. 8. and at that day it ſhall appear they were not loſt: their waters at that wedding day will be turned into wine.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon is taken from divine providence, ordering Cloſet occaſions, fit <note place="margin">2. Cloſet occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</note> only for ſecret expreſſing and opening them before the Lord, as ſome ſecret perſonal heart-plague, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 38. Some ſecret ſnares layed for this or that Saint of God by men or divels, as by ſo many curſed Fowlers. But in the uſe of this means of calling thus perſonally and particularly upon God; he delivered both Chriſt the Lord, and his members in particular, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 3. <hi>He ſhall deliver thee from the ſnare of the Fowler, &amp;c.</hi> and ver. 15. <hi>He ſhall call upon me, and I will anſwer him, &amp;c.</hi> The Saints by ſecret pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er do countermine the ſecret ſtratagems of their ſubtle enemies, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 9. 13, 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>The third Reaſon may be taken from the approved examples of the choiceſt of Gods <note place="margin">3. Examples of the Saints ſo exerciſed</note> Saints this way exerciſed. As that of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel three times a day,</hi> Dan. 6. 10. that of <hi>David</hi> as oft, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 55. 17. that of <hi>Iſaac</hi> uſing daily to go out into the <hi>fields alone, there to meditate,</hi> or <hi>pray,</hi> (as the <hi>Geneva</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reads it,) <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 63. That of the Lord Jeſus <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 35. <hi>Early in the morning</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he healed the Leper) <hi>he was praying</hi>

                     <hi>alone in a ſecret place.</hi> And <hi>Luke (chap.</hi> 5. 12 13, 14, 15. compared with verſe 16.) inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in a like practiſe of his, after that cure which he wrought: <hi>He withdrew himſelfe, and went into the wilderneſs and prayed,</hi> yet not much ſpace of time betwixt the one and the other. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 12. <hi>He went out into a Mountain, and continued all night in prayer:</hi> and he was then alone; for verſe 13. <hi>When it was day, he called, unto him his Diſciples. Matth.</hi> 14 22. he ſendeth away his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples firſt by ſhip: and <hi>verſe</hi> 23. <hi>He goeth apart into the Mountain to pray. Luke</hi> 21. 27. when he had been imployed in the day time in preaching, in the night time he went <hi>apart into the Mount of Olives;</hi> namely, to pray and meditate. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 41. <hi>He was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne from his Diſciples about a ſtones caſt, and prayed.</hi> and verſe 44. <hi>He prayed more earneſtly, &amp;c.</hi> and verſe 45. <hi>He roſe up from prayer and came to his Diſciples.</hi> And how he prevailed by theſe very ſolitary, but ſtrong cryes and tears in theſe dayes of his fleſh, or humane infirmity, is teſtified <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>He was heard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth Reaſon is taken from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs <note place="margin">4. The ſutable preſence of God in ſecret.</note> of the preſence and favour of God which he is wont in ſecret to exhibit to them unto their aimes and deſires. Their deſire is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Lord lift up thou the light of thy countenance upon us.</hi> And when is the Lord more with his Saints then when in ſecret? When <hi>Jacob</hi> is alone praying then <hi>Jehovah,</hi>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:46945:66"/> the Son of God that <hi>Angel,</hi> is in ſuch a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 23, 24, 28, 30, and <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12. 3, 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> compared. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one ſpecial way of the Saints walking with God, he cannot but be much in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with them: the neereſt and deareſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and fellowſhip with God is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by theſe ſecret communings with God, and holy wiſperings in his ear, the ſecret chamber is the moſt ſutable and freeſt place for theſe Spouſes of the Lord, to be telling their ſecrets to him; and there is the place where moſt ordinarily and uſually he is wont to meet and greet, and ſecretly embrace them.</p>
                  <p>Now let us come to ſuch Objections as <note place="margin">Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> are made againſt this holy exerciſe: for we may perceive by <hi>Job</hi> 21. 15. that mans car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal heart is ready to cavil againſt it, and to object, <hi>cui bono,</hi> to what purpoſe it, what needeth, what profit is it if we pray to him? Verily it is an ordinance wherein the Lord is wont very graciouſly to communicate himſelf to his Saints, and therefore ſo long as Satans wily head, and mans deceitful heart can find out cavils and quarrels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, it ſhall not want for Objections. Many a deadly wound is given to ſin and Satan by theſe prayer-darts, which the Saints thus ſecretly caſt at them; beſides, its a moſt ſpiritual ſervice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a ſpecial meaſure of ſincerity and ſelf-denial, and no wonder that of all other

In prayer with others, there is more to bribe, even the carnal heart to be ſpeaking; but here is little or nothing to move from mans applauſe, or the like. It is a duty very coſtly if rightly performed; in ſecret are the choice wreſtlings and weepings, and the like, and mans carnal heart would take the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and cheapeſt way rather: we are too apt to be objecting againſt our maine ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual foundations, and no wonder then if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this building work. We are too apt to failings and falls, and no wonder if ſo backward to this cloſer cloſet way of making up perſonal and particular accounts unto the Lord.

How do many look at Cloſet Prayer, to be at the beſt but a Free-will-Offering, (as they term it) which they offer if they will, but look not at it as a Duty which they muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon all occaſions?

And do not Miniſters cloſet ſins, as vanity of mind, vaine glorious reaſonings of ſpirit, liſtleſneſſe ſometimes to their holy work, call upon them for cloſet, ſtudy-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? Doth not their weighty cloſet work call for this? Is not Prayer (as once <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſaid) the beſt Book in our Study? Doth not Satan oft-times come into our ſtudies to aſſault us in our work, as ſometimes hee did <hi>Joſhuab</hi> the Prieſt in his? and had we not then more need then others to bee found oft praying there? The Lord vouchſafes oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be talking in friendly ſort with us in our Studies, and it were pity and ſhame if hereby we ſhould not maintain holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with him. Who are more potent with God in publick prayer, then ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as wreſtle it out moſt with God in ſecret praier? The gracious language which there they learn from the Spirit of God, and the

Who more prevalent with God then <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> this way exerciſed? we, as the friends of the Bridegroome (as <hi>Eliezar</hi> was of old) ſpeed the better in our work of gaining ſome ſpouſe for Chriſt that day, for which we have been moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in ſecret prayer before hand. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hereof, too oft maketh our miniſteriall work ſo unſucceſſefull; as it did that of the Diſciples, aſſaying to caſt out a devill, without praying before hand for it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 21. A Miniſter need not feare but hee ſhall preach well afterwards, if the Lord help him to pray well before hand: as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have more advantage of privacy, ſc their people make account they improve it this way: witneſſe their frequent commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their caſes to them, to ſpread them before the Lord in their prayers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them bee much with God in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</p>
                  <p>And let all our brethren and ſiſters, <note place="margin">All ſorts: for Chriſt brings us into his Chambers.</note> and every of them, make conſcience alſo of this duty of ſecret prayer; the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus bringeth us (my brethren) into his chambers, where he delighteth moſt to be, and reſt, and ſhew himſelfe and ſecrets to his Saints, <hi>Cantic.</hi> 1. 4. and ſhall not wee

Why ſhall not each Saint of God, of what condition ſoever, have here his retired oratory and place for ſecret praying unto God? each of them are by their calling, Gods hidden ones whilſt here, <hi>(Pſalme</hi> 83. 3.) and let them be ſo in this <note place="margin">Each Saint Gods hidden one.

The Church would have Chriſt goe aſide, as it were in private, and there ſhe will give him her loves; ſo let us in ſecret give him this ſpouſe-like love, fruits of our lips in ſecret, and there tell him all our hearts. The ſpirit
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46945:76"/> which is in the Saints, is a free ſpirit, <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 51. 12,) and truely there is the moſt free uſe and employment of that ſpirit in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when ſequeſtred as from all occaſions, ſo from all other company.

Let not wicked ones be more forward to ſet up an idoll in ſecret, or to ſet up a falſe Chriſt in the chambers, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. 8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 26. then we to honour the true God and Jeſus Chriſt thus in ſecret. And that wee may yet a little further preſſe this ſo weighty a duty; conſider that it is indeed our priviledge in many reſpects ordered, by the Lord in much wiſedome and faithfulneſſe, for our good alſo, as well as his glory; that hee will have us thus to ſeek him by our ſelves alone in prayer. For, 1. Hee therein tendreth the very credit of his people. They need not
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:46945:76"/> uncover their ſpiritual nakedneſſe before any man whatſoever, nor all their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal plagues need be unbared before men; it ſufficeth that they have this priviledged precept to pray to their Father, who ſeeth in ſecret, and tell him all their hearts. In <note place="margin">Beſt for ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all their ſecrets.</note> ſome caſes of perſonal ſins againſt brethren, perſonal confeſſion of ſuch ſins is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite; and ſometimes in caſe of ſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing burthen upon our hearts, wee are to goe to ſome faithfull Miniſter, or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Saint of God, and tell them our ſecret ayles; but in ordinary courſe, it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth that wee tell the Lord in ſecret, all our perſonall and particular failings and wants.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If ſolitary Praier were not Gods <note place="margin">Beſt for our neceſſities.</note> ordinance, what ſhould Gods ſolitary ones doe in ſundry caſes incident to them? But now <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in a ſolitary loanſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is encouraged, <hi>Call upon me, and I will anſwer thee.</hi> Jer. 33. 13. Sometimes the Saints are like Pelicans, and Owls in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 6. Well may they make their moans to the Lord, but are of all others reſpect deſtitute. Others would be like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther birds, fit to howt at them, and make a wonder of them; now welfare ſolitary prayer. Sometimes the Lord worketh upon ſome one of the family, a ſonne, or daughter, or ſervant, or the like; the reſt remain oppoſite to all good, ſaying, <hi>What profit ſhould we have by praying unto</hi>

Now it is well that prayer in a corner, where none ſeeth, or heareth but the Lord, is an acceptable ſervice, and ordinance. The poor ſlave in the infidels family, is now the Lords freeman for this buſineſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 21, 22. So the poore Chriſtian wife with whom her infidel husband liked to dwell, though he yet like not her religion, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 13.) ſhe may pray alone with acceptance.

But ſhortly come to lay downe, Firſt, ſome rules to guide us in it. Secondly, ſome meanes to help us in it. Thirdly, ſome markes to diſcover our gracious ſpeeding in it.</p>

The report of <hi>Philemons</hi> faith and love, makes <hi>Paul</hi> echo forth the ſound thereof in the ears of God by praying for him, <hi>Philem</hi> 4. 5. And it would be good to keep a freſh memorial of others graces, as <hi>Paul</hi> did of thoſe in the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> whence it was that he was ſo earneſt for them in his prayers. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. In the extenſiveneſs and intenſiveneſs of the mind and heart, and of each praying Grace of a godly Suppliant in his prayer. Our new Tranſlation rendreth that in <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 5. by a like phraſe as this in the Text, <hi>Prayer was made [without ceaſing.]</hi> but the word there in the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">

All our lines muſt meet in this center of Prayer; our
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46945:97"/> whole man muſt wait upon this as the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the holy Ghoſt: as it will ſhare in this bleſſing, ſo it muſt act in begging it; and then it will put on the garment of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes alſo for it. Like as before, the whole man went as it were in mourning weeds in the want of that bleſſing: ſo the mercy will be ſweeteſt to the whole man when it is thus holily imployed in the begging of it; or if the mercy be delayed, yet it can the more quietly ſit downe in the want of it, when it hath uſed Gods means for it. A gracious Chriſtian that prayeth much, can want much, hee hath that inward peace that guards his heart and mind from diſcontent. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6, 7. <hi>Make your requeſt knowne to God, and the peace of God ſhall keep your hearts.</hi>

Importunity in prayer, conſiſteth in <note place="margin">2 In frequent renewing of our ſuits.</note> a frequent renewing of our ſuits when wee are at this holy work, early and late; the Pſalmiſt was at it early, when hee ſayd, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. 13 <hi>My prayer ſhall prevent thee.</hi> and 119. 147. <hi>I prevented the dawning of the morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cryed, &amp;c.</hi> He was a good husband<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and earneſt in this holy work, who was at it ſo early; a lively Chriſtian will be up in his ſpirit, and hard at this work, when other lazy and drowzy profeſſours are not ſtirring this way. And verily hee had need be up betimes, who preventeth the Lord with his prayer, whoſe uſe it is before we call, to anſwer us, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65. 24.

The importunate ſuppliant alſo will be late at it, come for bread at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when he might have it inwardly ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him, that he cometh unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as that parable holdeth fotth, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 5. 8. He will pray with the firſt and with the laſt too, he will pray againe and againe. <hi>For this I beſought the Lord thrice,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 7, 8. His freſh ſuits freſhen up the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants praying graces; put a new gloſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his faith, love, feare, zeal, holy deſires, and the like. Sometimes the heart is more praying ripe then at other times; importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty tryeth concluſions, ſeeth how our hearts prayer-pulſes beat at all times; the heart is ſometimes more full of holy motions and workings, much more reſolute, more fixed upon God and good, much more tender and ſenſible. Importunity taketh all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the heart of a Chriſtian; an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate ſuppliant is wont to bee alwayes taking the skales and ballances into his hand, and in his thoughts putteth in the mercies hee needeth and longeth for, in the one skale; and all his prayers, pleas, and tears for the ſame in the other. And perceiving the mercies to weight downe all his praiers, he then layeth in more prayers and ſighs, and yet alas, they are not weight, which makes him ſtill to be laying weight after weight, prayer upon prayer al his days. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is the ſouls meſſenger, which it ſpeedeth to heaven, there to relate in the eares of its

Yea ſleightneſſe in praier laies a Chriſtian open to all manner of temptations. It even tempts that arch-robber and murderer of ſoules, the Devil, to bee making a booty of ſuch ſleighty profeſſours. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 37, 38. <hi>Watch and pray leſt you enter into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> The diſciples careleſneſs of praier made the more ready way to Sathan to tempt them to forſake their maſter.

As it is with other perſons who are betwixt ſleeping and waking, they are ſubject to dreames, ſo is it with ſuch like Chriſtians.</p>

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46945:110"/> temper of ſleightneſs; from hot they come to bee quite cold by this lukewarmeneſs; when Chriſtians are once beginning to take from the heighth and ſteep of fervency, they then haſte downeward apace, and if the Lord prevent not, they ſtay not till they fatally fall into the bottomeleſs pit. When Chriſtians grow indifferent in their deſires of grace, they grow as indifferent in their indeavours after it; and when once indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent whether they do work for God or no, they are fitteſt to bee hired to doe ſome worſe work. When Chriſtians through care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe in driving this holy trade of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, do not thrive, but go downe the wind amaine, 'tis twenty to one but they will be taking up ſome other trade: it may bee of covetous perſons, it may be of time-ſervers, it may be of drunkards, it may be of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, it may be of hereticks, or opinioniſts, or the like.</p>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:46945:110"/> there is a ſecret moth that eateth out the ſtrength and beauty of it, and it is too often found, that whilſt ſuch are ſlightly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pething and trifling about the greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their ſouls, the Lord leaveth offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his rich mercies to them, and whilſt they are making ſome complemental ſuits to <note place="margin">Divine forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings.</note> Chriſt, hee at length will be woed no more by them, and that ſad curſe of God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt them in <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 26 <hi>And the Lord will be no more named by any mouth of the men of Judah,</hi> cometh to be fulfilled in ſuch looſe-hearted profeſſours.

                  <p>VVE come now to the ſecond thing included in the Modification of this duty of prayer; that it bee <hi>without ceaſing.</hi> Namely, that we pray opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>without ceaſing,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

He meaneth that upon all occaſions, and as he had any opportunity, hee did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him in his prayers. Hee taketh all opportunities offered by the Lord to pray, and omitteth them not; he praieth <hi>without ceaſing.</hi> It is then the duty of all the Lords people to pray opportunely, or to take all holy opportunities to pray unto the Lord. For the better handling of this duty, conſider theſe particulars,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that it is ſeldome that any time is unſeaſonable for prayer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that yet there is a time when the Lord will not liſten to prayer, no, not of his owne people.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that in mercy the Lord uſeth to offer unto his people opportunities and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of prayer.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that the Lords people are bound to take or improve all ſuch opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of prayer.</p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:46945:115"/>
                  <p> Touching the firſt very briefly, that it is <note place="margin">Prayer is rarely unſeaſonable at any time.</note> very rare that any time is unſeaſonable for prayer, it appeares in this that the Saints are injoyned to pray alwayes; <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 36: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 18. And this, that the title of God, is to <hi>be a God hearing prayers. Pſal.</hi> 65. 1, 2. <hi>O thou that art hearing</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Touching the ſecond a little more largely, <note place="margin">Sometimes prayer is not ſo ſeaſonable.</note> that there is a time when the Lord will not liſten to prayer, no, not of his people; ſo that praying at ſuch times, they pray out of due ſeaſon. It is not then ſo fit a time for them to pray. As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When they are under offences unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented <note place="margin">1 When the perſons pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are under juſt offences.</note> of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>Firſt be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi> It is not ſeaſonable for <hi>Jobs</hi> freinds to come to offer to God, until reconciled to injured <hi>Job. Job.</hi> 42, 78. If we are out with the favourites of the King of Saints, it is not ſeaſonable to come to the King with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions.

                  <p>Now let us conſider of prayer-ſeaſons <note place="margin">Moſt ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pray.</note> offered by the Lord, which hee requireth us to take. Theſe opportunities are either generall or ſpecial. The general opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <note place="margin">1 When God is near us: more generally by his word.</note> of prayer, is that general Seaſon of grace held forth in the offers of the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of the Goſpel. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 5, 6. <hi>Seek him whileſt he may be found.</hi> Whilſt God may be found, it is a ſeaſon to ſeek him. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 21 12. <hi>If you will inquire, returne, come.</hi> Whilſt the Prophets incourage to come, 'tis a ſeaſon to inquire.

This bleſſed day work is moſt ſutable to the day time of the Goſpel and grace of God. But beſides this general opportunity, there are ſome more ſpecial praying ſeaſons, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 31. 8. <hi>For this ſhal every one that is godly pray unto thee in a finding time</hi> (as it is in the Hebrew). As bountifull Princes have their, ſo the Lord
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:46945:117"/> hath his ſpecial ſeaſons for petitioners to come in with their ſuits, and have each their dayes of audience.</p>
                  <p>Our bleſſed Father hath his ſet dayes of paying to each child his portion of mercy &amp; bleſſing upon demand and ſuit for it. Now theſe ſpecial ſeaſons of prayer are of three ſorts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When God in ſpecial ſort is near to us. Or ſecondly, we in ſpecial ſort near to him. Or thirdly, in caſe of emergencies or ſpecial neceſſities calling for ſpeedy help.</p>

                        </gap>A</note> us, then call upon him <hi>while he is near. Iſ.</hi> 55. 6. The Lord as our gracious king goeth his holy progreſſe, and now he is nearer this people, and ſuch and ſuch ſubjects; and now againe he is nearer to others: Let each ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly take and obſerve their particular ſeaſons of holy approaches to him with their ſuits. If the loadſtone be near, the very iron moveth; the approaches of the Lord to us, have, or ſhould have this holy magnetical attractive vertue to draw us near to him in Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Now the Lord is thus in ſpecial <note place="margin">2 By ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial act of mercy.</note> ſort near to us, by ſome ſpecial mercy vouchſafed to us, as when anſwering to former prayer or the like. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 18. <hi>The Lord is nigh to them that are of a broken heart.</hi> Yea, but wherein, or whereby doth he ſhew that he is nigh to them? It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>He ſaveth ſuch as be of a contrite ſpirit.</hi>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:46945:117"/> Gods ordering ſome ſpecial favour to his people by his providence is called his viſiting of his people. The Saints repairing to the Lord with earneſt fervent Prayer, is called their viſiting of the Lord. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26. 16. <hi>Lord in trouble have they viſited thee;</hi> how? <hi>tbey have powred out a prayer to thee, &amp;c.</hi> When God firſt beginneth to give us a gracious viſit, it is ſeaſonable and ſutable for us to give him prayer-viſits. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 17. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, I will do this thing alſo which thou hast ſpoken, verſe</hi> 18. <hi>And Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſayd, I beſeech thee ſhew me thy glory. Moſes</hi> made Gods time of giving to bee his opportunity of begging mercy. If ever the Saints hearts are filled with love, it is when they partake of manifeſt tokens of the Lords love to them; and if ever it be a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this friendly talking with God, or praying, 'tis then, when in ſuch a friendly frame. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 1. <hi>I love the Lord becauſe he hath heard my voice.</hi> And <hi>verſe</hi> 2. <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I call upon him,</hi> or ſpeak lovingly to him. Words ſpoken to God in love, or from love to him, come the moſt ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, for they are ever well taken, they are taken in love by the Lord. When the Lord in his providence beſtoweth upon his people ſomething whereon the image of his ſpecial favour is inſtamped, it is a time in ſpecial to acknowledge the Lord by prayer, as praying is called, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>In all thy ways acknowledge him,</hi> even by prayer of faith.</p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:46945:118"/>
                  <p> Secondly, the Lord is thus near to us by <note place="margin">2 By ſpecial motions of his ſpirit.</note> any ſpecial motions of the ſpirit, eſpecially ſuch as put us upon prayer; when the Lord doth inwardly ſpeak, even to our hearts ſuch like words, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43. 11. Ask of me touching my ſons and daughters, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the work of my hands command ye me, or when Chriſt by his ſpirit ſaith to our hearts, as ſometimes he did to them by word of mouth. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 23, 24. <hi>Hitherto yee have asked nothing: Ask that your joy may bee full.</hi> Or as hee ſaid to his people, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Let me heare thy voice, for it is ſweet;</hi> it is now a time to ſpeak to the Lord, that we ſeeme not to ſlight him. <hi>When thou ſaidſt,</hi> (namely, by the ſpirit inwardly as well as by the word outwardly) <hi>ſeek my</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 27. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>face; my heart anſwered, thy face Lord will I ſeek.</hi> If that holy motion to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 5, 9. <hi>Ask what I ſhall give to thee, &amp;c.</hi> made even a ſleeping-time, a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating-time; much more may holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God this way, make our waking-times, our wreſtling ſeaſons. Such drops of a ſpirit of prayer are handſells and pledges of large powring out of that ſpirit upon us, if thankfully received and improved. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. Such ſolliciting directions given us from the Lord, argue that aſſuredly it is both a praying and ſpeeding time. If the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the heart, if he fit it, and put it upon prayer, teach it how to pray, <hi>He ſurely bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the eare to heare. Pſal.</hi> 10. 17. It is
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:46945:118"/> 
                     <hi>Eſthers</hi> time to ask, when King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> himſelfe putteth her upon it; <hi>What is thy petition? and it ſhall be granted thee; and thy requeſt? it ſhall be performed. Eſther</hi> 7. 2. So is it here. And let none abuſe this to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then any fond <hi>Grindletonian</hi> conceit, that we muſt never pray till wee find the ſpirit firſt moving us to it. It is our opportunity indeed of prayer when the ſpirit moveth thereto, but not the onely ſeaſon of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as wee have in part ſhewed, and muſt further mention other ſeaſons thereof as well as that. Wee muſt ſometimes pray, that we may pray, and when as we are apt to judge our ſelves, that wee are moſt unfit to pray, then to pray that wee may become fit to pray. As by ſpeaking men are fitted to ſpeak, by running to runne, by wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to wreſtle, by labouring to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he is thus near us by ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <note place="margin">2 By ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial promiſes made ours.</note> word of his mouth, eſpecially by ſome gracious promiſe ſpoken and manifeſted to us; and that alſo is a ſpecial ſeaſon for prayer. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 27. <hi>For thou O Lord God haſt revealed to thy ſervant, ſaying, I will build thee an houſe, therefore hath thy ſervant found in his heart to pray unto thee.</hi> Its a ſeaſon of this holy talking with God, when he firſt enters ſpeech with us by ſome ſuch words of his grace. Its ſeaſonable to open our mouths wide, and receive grace and peace when the Lord ſetteth open any ſuch
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:46945:119"/> golden pipe of both as is the Promiſe: the Goſpel is in every part of it, <hi>the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the ſpirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>and of life, verſe</hi> 6. <hi>and of faith. Rom.</hi> 10 8. <hi>and of peace. Eſai.</hi> 57. 19. The words of Gods grace pacifie and ſtill the tumults in the ſoul, and inlarge and quicken the heart. Now if ever it bee a ſeaſon to ſpeak to the Lord in praier, it is when unmannerly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, (which too often ſilence us at beſt) retreat, and are put to ſilence, and when our hearts are ſet at an holy liberty to powre out themſelves before the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Lord is near his people <note place="margin">4 By ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> when he viſits or afflicteth them. <hi>What ſhal I anſwer him when he viſits</hi> (or afflicts?) <hi>Job</hi> 31. 14. and <hi>Job</hi> 7. 18. <hi>What is man that thou ſhouldeſt viſit him?</hi> The Lord is then near to us to try us, to take an account of our wayes, to correct our miſ-doings to obſerve how we carry it under affliction, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſupport us in affliction, to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie affliction to us, and to ſave and deliver us out of the ſame, and therefore in ſpecial ſort it is ſeaſonable to cry unto him, and to ask a correcting father forgiveneſſe. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>If any be afflicted, let him pray. Pſal.</hi> 50. 15. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will heare thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> God doth then ſpeak to us by his rods, <hi>Micah</hi> 69. It is therefore ſeaſonable then to anſwer him in our praiers, If ever a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart bee humble, ſenſible, ſerious
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46945:119"/> and lively, it is then when in affliction, when in the fire. Such a time of pangs is a time of crying out to the Lord; when God viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Saints by affliction, it is ſeaſonable for them to viſit him with prayers: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26. 16. <hi>Lord in trouble have they viſited thee, they powred out a prayer to thee when thy chaſtning was upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Lord is near to us by ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial deliverance out of affliction: this is <note place="margin">5 By ſome ſpecial delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> likewiſe the Lords viſiting time when hee cometh to ſee us, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>For the Lord their God ſhall viſit them, and ſave them from their captivity.</hi> If God wil thus viſit his vine, the people of God look at themſelves as ingaged to call upon him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. 14. 18. compared. <hi>Behold, viſit this thy vine, quicken us, ſo will we call upon thee.</hi> When the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Churches afflictions and captivity is over, Chriſt expecteth to heare his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches voice in prayer. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 10, 14. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>I will bring that third part through fire, and they ſhall call upon me.</hi> A perſon newly delivered out of <hi>this pit, Job</hi> 33. 24, 36. <hi>Hee ſhall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him.</hi> Little do Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ſharing in a time of the Lords cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and pity, in their deliverance from ſick-bed, and other notable hazards of life and livelyhoods, know, what a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity they have now in their hands to ſpeak for further mercy, ſo as to ſpeed; and how much they loſe if they grow ſlighty or
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:46945:120"/> negligent in improving ſuch an importunity of praier, when if ever, praying diſpoſitions ſtir afreſh in them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. God is thus near us when his time <note place="margin">6 By accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing his promiſes actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</note> of ſpecial promiſes draweth near. Then Gods Faithfulneſſe, Immutability, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſſe begin to come into our very views. And it is a ſeaſon then for us in our prayers to goe out and meet the Lord. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 12. <hi>Then ſhall ye call on me, and ye ſhall goe and pray unto me, and I will hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When? verſe</hi> 10. <hi>When the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years ſhall be accompliſhed at Babylon, I will viſit you, and performe my good pleaſure towards you, and then ſhall you call upon me. Dan.</hi> 9. 2, 3. <hi>I Daniel underſtood by Bookes the number of the years whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet, that hee would accompliſh ſeventy years in this deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeruſalem; and I ſet my face unto the Lord to ſeek by prayer and ſupplication.</hi> Such a time is a ſpeeding-time, for ſo <hi>verſe</hi> 23. <hi>At the beginning of thy ſupplications the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement came forth:</hi> and therefore the fitteſt ſeaſon for prayer. A fair day may well be expected to enſue, when the Saints are, ſo early at this work of prayer, even as ſoon as any morning beam of divine righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe begins to break forth. And ſurely, ſuch a time is this very preſent time, when if ever, now it is a ſeaſon of frequent and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent praying. When the Lord is coming out in view to accompliſh his great deſigns
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:46945:120"/> of grace to his churches, and vengeance to Antichriſt and his abettors. When his wondrous workes in our native land, and the neighbour-nations doe declare that his name is near.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond ſpeciall ſeaſon of prayer is, <note place="margin">Secondly, when we are near to God. As.</note> when we are neere to the Lord (There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times when we are far off from God.) True it is, that all the Saints are alwayes neere unto the Lord, in reſpect of their reconciliation wrought by Chriſt, and their Union with Chriſt, God-man, and the like. Yet are there differences of their <note place="margin">1 By ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> actuall neerneſſe to the Lord in many other reſpects, as might be ſhewed in ſundry particulars. Let us inſtance only in two or three branches of this holy neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ours to God. Which are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall opportunities of prayer.</p>
                  <p>Wee are neere to God by ſome ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne engagement, whether more publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ſecretly plighted before the Lord. Thus Iſrael Pſal. 148. 14. was a people neere to the Lord. And <hi>what Nation is there ſo great</hi> (ſaid <hi>Moſes</hi> Deut. 4. 7.) <hi>unto whom God is ſo neer, as the Lord our God is neer to us in all that wee call unto him for?</hi> Jer. 30. 21. <hi>I will cauſe him to draw neere, and he ſhall approach to me: for who is this that engagaged his heart to approach unto me ſaith the Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, wee are neere to God, <note place="margin">2 By ſome choice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming work.</note> when upon any worke of Reformation of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:46945:121"/> ſpeciall enormities in our ſelves or others, which alienates them or us from the Lord. Zealous-reforming-rulers, whoſe hearts ſtand bent, as much as in them lieth, to reduce the Church to its Primitive purity and perfection, they are ſaid in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect alſo, as well as others, <hi>to engage themſelves to approach to the Lord.</hi> Jer. 30. 20, 21. compared. So zealous reforming <hi>Aſa,</hi> and others joyning with him in that work, are ſaid to be with God. 2 Chron. 14. 2, 3, 4, 5. and 15. 2, 7, 8. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. So thoſe zealous friends of Chriſt that ſet themſelves againſt the Babyloniſh whore, and her abominations, are ſaid to <hi>bee with Chriſt.</hi> Revel. 17. 14. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are with him, ſo he is that while with them, as he ſaid. 2 Chron. 15. 2. <hi>The Lord is with you whilſt you are with him.</hi> And there being ſuch neerneſſe 'twixt them and God, then ſurely is it a choice ſeaſon of ſpeaking with God in prayer. For indeed 'tis a choice ſpeeding time, as the Prophet there addeth. <hi>And if you ſeek him, he will be found of you.</hi> Iſa. 1. 16, 17, 18. <hi>Waſh you, make you cleane, &amp;c. Come now and let us reaſon together:</hi> it is the fitteſt time to offer up this holy incenſe of prayer in theſe fiery-zealous-times; and to plead with the Lord when make-bate and alienating ſinnes are removed. Thus godly <hi>Nehemiah</hi> taketh ſuch an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for prayer, Nehem. 13. 14. 22.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:46945:121"/> 29. 31. <hi>Remember me ô my God for good.</hi> When the graces of the ſpirit have been ſtirring in one good work, they are the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to be imployed in another. And when we have been doing for God, if we take the advantage of time and of our hearts to ſpeak to him, he will be doing for us; if wee give any thing to him, he will aſſuredly give us ſomething that is better if we ask it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third ſpecial ſeaſon of prayer is, <note place="margin">3 When in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As in caſe of</note> when any ſpecial extremities and urgencies are upon us. Prayer being one of our laſt meanes to bee uſed for attaining ſuccour from God; and our very extremities having their cry in the eares of the Lord, it will be moſt ſeaſonable that wee joyne our lips with theirs, that they make together the lowder and more prevailing out-cry. Its meeteſt for us then to goe a begging to the door of Grace, when in ſuch extreame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. God accounts the time of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities in asking, to bee his opportunities of hearing and helping. Let us inſtance in theſe foure caſes.</p>

                  <p>WE come now to the third and laſt thing held forth in the modificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the practiſe of this duty of prayer, that it be <hi>without ceaſing, (i. e.)</hi> Indeſinently, or conſtantly. It is then our duty to pray indeſinently, or conſtantly. Now for this, Conſider,</p>

                  <p>Touching the firſt: To pray indeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently or conſtantly is, Not to give out from praying: not to let God alone untill hee doe bleſſe us, <hi>To pray and not to faint,</hi> Luke 18. 1.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea verily: Gods own dear Saints may be weary in praying, though <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> not ſo weary of prayer. The duty it ſelfe is to them very deſirable, in it ſelfe: but the diſcouragements may be ſuch in tempted times, that they may be even afraid to goe to God, to ſeek his face ſometimes. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. 6.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46945:124"/> 
                     <hi>I am weary with my groaning,</hi> and 69. 3. <note place="margin">Godly ones may give out from prayer for a little ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> 
                     <hi>I am weary of my crying,</hi> yet hee gave not off wholly, or not long, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. <hi>But as for me, my prayer is unto thee.</hi> If they give out for a ſpurt from ſolemn Prayer, they ceaſe not to be darting up ejaculatory pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. 4. <hi>I ſayd I am caſt out of thy ſight, yet will I looke unto thy holy Temple.</hi> When God in deſerted times ſeemeth to turne his back upon his Saints, or they through diſtruſt, and diſtempers are as if turning their back upon him, yet they give many of theſe love-caſts of the eyes of their ſouls towards God; deſires will be ever and anon ſtepping out of ſuch a gracious heart to look after the Lord. That holy fire within the heart albeit it blazeth not out, yet will be ever and anon ſending out theſe ſparks. There are times wherein the Saints are ſo ſpiritually ſick of ſinne and of temptations, that their very ſpeech faileth them; even they have their ſpiritual ſwounds and may lye a while ſpeechleſſe, yet either they are making theſe holy ſignes in their fainting fits, or ſome of this holy breath is ſtirring. If <hi>Hezekiah</hi> cannot ſpeak out in ſolemne prayer, yet can he chatter, and make theſe ſhorter holy mutterings of his heart, and theſe dove like moanes of his ſpirit. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38. 14. <hi>I am oppreſſed, O Lord undertake for me.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sometimes through ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous fall into ſome heinous ſin: as other ſpeech is ſometimes loſt by bodily falls, ſo is this by ſuch ſpiritual falls. So <hi>David</hi> after his <note place="margin">2 By reaſon of ſad falls.</note> great fall into the ſinnes of murder and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, lay ſpeechleſſe in this reſpect for a while, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 3. <hi>When I kept ſilence my bones waxed old;</hi> ſo do dangerous declinings and backſlidings in religion occaſion ſome <note place="margin">Backſliding.</note> temporary ceſſation of ſolemne prayer: hence <hi>Iſai</hi> 43. 22. <hi>Thou haſt not called upon me O Jacob, but haſt been weary of me O Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> So <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64. 7. <hi>There is none that calleth upon thy name, that ſtirreth up himſelfe to take hold of thee.</hi> Great guilt breedeth great horrour and great deſpondency of mind and heart, which with unbeliefe blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it ſelfe, cauſeth poor Chriſtians even to give off prayer in their deſperate fits. Look as Heathen <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid to his brother, I would pray to the Gods for thoſe things, but that they have given over to hear my prayers: or as deſperate <hi>Saul,</hi> perceiving <note place="margin">Strength of unbelief.</note> God anſwereth him no more, will goe to him no more to inquire, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. So it is thus far forth with the Saints; ſo far as deſperate diſpondencies grow upon them, and repreſent the Lord to their ſouls as all juſtice, they dare not come to him in theſe fits. Sometimes they pore too much upon diſcouragements, which they meet with in <note place="margin">Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:46945:125"/> prayer, within themſelves alſo: as that they pray with ſo many diſtempers and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons intermixed, and with ſo little life, or liberty of ſpirit, or comfort, or quiet, or faith, or good ſucceſſe, and the like, that as good never a whit, as never the better, and they are even loth ſometimes to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to pray. And ſometimes Chriſtians fall into ſome ſuch errours touching prayer, <note place="margin">Errours.</note> as for a time doe take them off from it, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that God being a ſpirit muſt be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped only in ſpirit and truth, and ſo not by any bodily worſhip. That bodily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe even in prayer profiteth not; that all outward forms of worſhip are aboliſhed. The Chriſtians muſt have ſome immediate light of the ſpirit, and unwonted ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons putting them upon prayer, if at any time they doe ſet upon prayer, if at any time they doe ſet upon prayer. Theſe and ſundry like deluſive principles, too rife in theſe latter dayes, make too great and too long interruptions with too many hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full profeſſours in this holy exerciſe of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn prayer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To pray indeſinently, is to maintaine <note place="margin">2 To main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a praying ſpirit.</note> praying diſpoſitions: that albeit we actually pray not without intermiſſion, or doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but pray, (as thoſe fanatical <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites</hi> of old) yet in the inward frame and bent of our heart, wee ceaſe not prayer. There is ſtill a ſpirit in us, <hi>crying, Abba Father, Gal.</hi> 4. 6. a diſpoſing us upon all occaſions to goe to God as a Father in
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:46945:126"/> prayer. Chriſtians of all ſorts, both Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and others, muſt have their vials full of prayers ready ſtill to powre them out, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they actually doe not powre them out without intermiſſion. They are to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy evermore to offer up thoſe holy odours, and that holy incenſe, though not alwaies actually offering the ſame. <hi>Revel.</hi> 5. 8. The church in its members, muſt have hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb-lips ready to drop this ſweet, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome hony of prayer, albeit they bee not dropping the ſame every moment. <hi>Cantic.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Thy lips drop as the hony-comb.</hi> And good reaſon is it why each gracious perſon ſhould maintain alwayes a praying frame in their hearts; for a praying frame is a moſt <note place="margin">A praying frame, a moſt filial frame.</note> ſon-like, child-like frame. If ever the love of ſons and daughters of God be ſtirring in them, it is then: if ever their hearts are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with holy awe of God, and faith in him, it is then: if ever they are ready to doe any thing for God, it is then. The ſame ſpirit which is to them a ſpirit of ſonnes, a ſpirit of adoption, acteth in them as a ſpirit of Prayer, and where there is a ſpirit moving to Prayer, or <hi>cry, Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> there is a ſpirit of adoption: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. Againe a frame of Prayer is the moſt <note place="margin">A moſt ſweet and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble frame.</note> ſweet, calme and comfortable, and thence in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>oppoſed to the ſpirit of bondage, working feare,</hi> amazing, diſcouraging, ſinking fear. But this breeding and feeding filial boldneſſe, and freeneſſe with God, as a child with his Father. </p>

                  <p> Againe, it is a moſt free, and beſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged frame of ſpirit: and hence alſo <note place="margin">A priviledged frame.</note> oppoſed to that ſervile frame, and imbon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daging fear. <hi>ibid.</hi> Is any free to pray, &amp; free in praying? ſurely thoſe imbondaging cords of ſlaviſh diſtempers are broken in ſunder.</p>
                  <p>A praying frame is likewiſe a moſt evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical <note place="margin">An evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal frame.</note> frame: being redeemed from the lawes rigour and confinement, we are moſt at liberty to addreſſe our ſelves thus, as children to our heavenly Father. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 5, 6. <hi>To redeeme them that were under the law, that we might receive the Adoption of ſonnes:</hi> and <hi>becauſe yee are ſonnes, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Sonne in your hearts, crying, Abba Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A praying frame is alſo a moſt heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">A heavenly and gracious frame.</note> and gracious frame. A ſpirit of grace, and a ſpirit of ſupplication, or a ſpirit diſpoſing, or carrying out to powre out holy Supplications, are inſeparable companions. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>I will powre out upon them a ſpirit of grace and of ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> No grace is wanting where a ſpirit of prayer is not wanting.

                  <p>A praying frame is an humble frame of heart, the Saints never mourne more ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over their ſinnes, even as crucifying the Lord Jeſus, then when in ſuch a frame. <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A praying frame is a believing frame, <note place="margin">An humble and believing frame.</note> and a believing frame is a praying frame; then have they the moſt clear and effectual

It hath been proved that both are duties, and the Saints will have reſpect to all, and every of Gods Commandements: As a Chriſtian is conſidered ſingly and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo cloſet, ſecret retired prayer apart lyeth upon him; but as in relation to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo alſo prayer with others is his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as his eſtate is, ſo is his bond of duty
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:46945:129"/> doubled. The carnall heart of man will more cavill, and ſtartle at ſecret prayer by our ſelves alone, then at that with others: our natures will leſſe eaſily be ſtrangers to ſervices, to which others are privie (as we ſee in Hypocrites, and Familiſts.) than to ſuch as the Lord onely beholdeth: but no wiles or ſlights of our hearts or Satan, ſhould draw us from a commanded duty in Scripture. And indeed, we under the Goſpel ſhould not be leſſe in holy ſerving of God with our ſpirits, than thoſe under the Law, but rather more. Hence it is, that the wooden or Incenſe Altars for the incenſe of prayer, is in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally repreſented to be much larger under the times of the Goſpel, than ever under the Law.

Hence a Spirit of ſupplication promiſed in thoſe dayes,

                  <p>As for Reaſons why we ought to pray <note place="margin">Reaſons why we muſt pray conſtantly.</note> thus indeſinently, they are briefly theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that the Lord is very conſtant <note place="margin">1 God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in calling upon us.</note> in calling upon us. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 65. 12. He dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpreads out his hands to us: we may well bee daily lifting up our hearts and hands to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that Jeſus Chriſt intercedeth for <note place="margin">2 Chriſt is conſtant in pleading for us.</note> us without ceaſing, he ever liveth to make interceſſion for us, coming unto God by him. It is all his worke in a manner, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 15. and 9. 14. Therefore wee may well be ſo much taken up with this buſineſſe of prayer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In that the maine matters of our <note place="margin">3 Choice things beg'd are perpetuall.</note> prayers are everlaſting matters; and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting mercies call for inceſſant prayers; yea the prayſes one day to bee returned for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of prayers, will be everlaſting, and there would bee ſome proportion of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity in our holy prayers.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In that the Lord ceaſeth not bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:46945:130"/> of us, till we ceaſe begging: but if we <note place="margin">4 God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth to bleſſe whileſt wee continue to aske.</note> give out from praying, hee will forbear his wonted giving: ſo long as <hi>Abraham</hi> held on asking, the Lord held on anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. When <hi>Abraham</hi> left off Communing with the Lord, he goeth up from <hi>Abraham.</hi> If <hi>Joaſh</hi> be ſcanty in ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with his darts, his victories over the <hi>Syrians</hi> are the leſſe. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 18, 19. Fewer ſpirituall wreſtlings will iſſue in few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſpirituall Conqueſts. The oyle of grace ſtill runneth, as long as there are empty veſſels to receive the ſame. As ſometime Sir <hi>Walter-Raleigh</hi> anſwered Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> demand: when he would leave begging of her: not till your Majeſty (ſaid he) ceaſe giving: ſo ſhould we, perceiving <hi>that whileſt wee ſeek the Lord, he is found of us.</hi> As 2 Chron. 15. 2. We ſhould reſolve, to hold on ſeeking, pray as long as wee proſper in it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In that, holy conſtancy in prayer, <note place="margin">5 Conſtancy in prayer argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth integrity in it.</note> will bee an argument of moſt integrity in it. The Hypocrite will not pray alwayes. <hi>Job.</hi> 27. 8, 10. They are elect ones which are ſo inceſſant in prayer. <hi>Cry night and day,</hi> Luke 18, 7. They are naturall fruits to trees, which they bring forth conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So conſtancy in holy prayer, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth prayer to be in a holy wiſe naturall to us as Saints, and that there is in us ſome praying nature: It is a beame of Divine Immutability, amidſt variety of Changes
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:46945:131"/> in other things, yet to be inchangeable in our way and courſe of holineſſe, and ſo of prayer. The Saints as Saints, whatever their changes otherwiſe may be, yet are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>From beyond the river of Aethyopia ſhall my ſuppliants come.</hi> That is, my Saints, my effectual called ones, which will be continually, even naturally making holy ſupplications to me. If abroad, they are conſcionable of prayer, and ſo likewiſe if at home. If free, then free to pray; if bond, yet the Lords free men to pray. In priviledged and peaceable times, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue praying, and ſo they doe in boyſterous and troubleſome times; whilſt the light of God ſhineth in their tabernacles, and on their ſpirits, they labour in prayer; and ſo in darkneſſe of temptations, afflictions, &amp;c. and yet they hold on praying.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In that ſpecial and deſirable benefits, <note place="margin">6 Special bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings attained by conſtancy in prayer.</note> come by conſtancy in prayer: for which onely conſider that place, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34, 35, 36. Its a ſpecial help againſt all worldly temptations. If we would not be far char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with cares of this life, pray alwayes. Men much in prayer with God are ever the moſt weaned from the world. They have ſo many ſweet diſcourſes with God, that other talks with the world are more harſh and burthenſome to them; they are ſo oft in ſpeech with the Spouſe of their ſouls, that they cannot affect to ſpeak familiarly with that Strumpet. They are ſo much in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46945:131"/> that their ſpirits cannot bee much in earth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. 19, 20. They drive ſo rich and gainful a trade in that celeſtial City, that they have little liſt or delight to bee pedling elſewhere about trifles. They fare ſo well at their fathers houſe, that they care not for the devils husks, or the worlds ſcraps. It is likewiſe a meanes to eſcape the diſpleaſure of God, which lighteth upon others; to eſcape that which cometh as a ſnare, which taketh and holdeſt faſt, and bruiſeth, cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and killeth others. <hi>ibid.</hi> Beſides, it is a means to fit us for Chriſts ſecond coming. <hi>Pray alwayes,</hi> that ye may bee accounted worthy to eſcape all theſe things, and to ſtand before the Sonne of man. Perſons much in prayer do ſo oft ſet up Tribunals in their owne hearts, ſo frequently doe they make up juſt accounts with God in Chriſt, and ſo many times in their prayers are they making references of matters unto that day, that they familiarize with their Judge, and do in a manner facilitate the buſineſſe of that day, ſo far as it concerneth them.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. Touching the Conditions required to ſuch manner of praying without ceaſing: and firſt of Faith in Prayer.</head>
                  <p>HAving ſpoken of the nature of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of prayer here injoyned, and of that which is implyed in the notion of praying <hi>without ceaſing,</hi> We come now to the third thing at firſt propounded to conſideration: namely, the conditions which are required in ſuch praying importunely, opportunely, or conſtantly. Now theſe conditions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant prayer are four. 1. Faith. 2. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. 3. Sincerity. 4. Watchfulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then concerning Faith in prayer: this is a principle requiſite to prayer, it is even all in all in it; without this prayer is in effect no prayer unto the Lord, hence accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table prayer is called the <hi>prayer of faith, Jam.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>The prayer of faith ſhal ſave the ſick.</hi> Its not ſo much a Chriſtians prayer, as his faith in prayer which prevaileth with God for a gracious anſwer. <hi>Whatſoever yee ask believing, yee ſhall receive. Matth.</hi> 21. 23. It is faith which maketh a mans perſon firſt acceptable, and no wonder then if ſuch an ones prayer prevaile. <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> both ſacrifice, hypocrites as well as upright ones pray. <hi>God had reſpect unto Abel, and unto his offering, yet not to Caine. Gen.</hi> 4 4.</p>
                  <p>But it was by faith that <hi>Abel</hi> offered a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:46945:133"/> more excellent ſacrifice then <hi>Cain.</hi> Faith is <note place="margin">The neceſſity of faith in prayer.</note> the inſtrument whereby the ſpots and ſtains which elſe might blaſt us and our prayers are removed, both from our perſons and prayers. <hi>God purifies our hearts by faith, Act.</hi> 15. 9: <hi>We are ſanctified by faith. Act.</hi> 26. 19. Faith is a meanes to make the holineſſe of Chriſts perſon and prayers ours, and that muſt needs be acceptable to the Lord. <hi>My beloved is mine,</hi> all his holineſſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is mine, ſaith the believing Church. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 16. Faith intereſted the ſaints in all the ſuccouring attributes and titles of God, or offices and titles of Chriſt in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, and all the particular promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which we need to improve in prayer: &amp; what then more needfull or uſefull in praier then faith? Faith ſheweth a godly ſoule, where all its ſuccour lyeth, and where all its ſtrength and life is to be had, and after that maketh the utmoſt improvement of all in prayer. Its faith which maketh the Saints keep their due diſtances in prayer. Giveth God and Chriſt their due, grace and mercy its due; our ſelves, and our ſpiritual ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which we complaine of, their due: It ſetteth, and (as I may ſay) placeth God and Chriſt in his proper place, ſeat, and throne, putteth us into an holy Athletique plight, ordereth the bounds, proportions, and motions of prayer, and then taketh its beſt ſeaſon, and holy advantages, both of God and of our ſelves, to effect and bring
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:46945:134"/> about the deſires which ſpring from our faith. Faith is a lively ſpark indeed, and putteth life, both into the ſuppliants, and into their ſupplications. Bee wee never ſo dead, dumb, ſapleſſe, and liſtleſſe in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals; if faith begin once to be ſtirring, it putteth life into the buſineſſe. Now for the better handling of this principall requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to inceſſant prayer, Conſider,</p>

Faith in the immenſity and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence <note place="margin">1 In Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſitie.</note> of God is required in prayer. True it is, faith in prayer doth and muſt look at God as in heaven, in reſpect of his more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manifeſtation and communication of himſelfe. Hence that, <hi>Our father which art</hi>

                     <hi>in heaven, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 6. <hi>Art not thou God in heaven? And</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 21. <hi>Hear in heaven thy dwelling place.</hi> It is a great help to an heavenly ſpirit in prayer, and to high and holy aimes. It is a notable curb to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine carnall deſires and thoughts in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to eye God as in heaven. But yet albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, faith with its eager eye pierce the clouds, and behold the Lord as above all, yet alſo, as in all, and through all. Hee conceiveth of God as comprehending heaven it ſelfe, and not comprehended either of heaven or earth. So did <hi>Solomon</hi> by faith in that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 27. eye God as one whom the heaven of heaven could not containe. Whereſoever the Saints are praying, they are praying as before God. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Daniel prayeth and giveth thanks before God.</hi> So did <hi>Nehemiah, chap.</hi> 1. 4: Neither is any frame more ſutable to prayer then that lawfull working of heart which proceedeth from faith in Gods immenſity. And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more quickning to ſerious attention, and intention to the duty, and to comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expectation of the iſſue, then a lively apprehenſion, that we ſpeak not to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but to a preſent deity, not to a friend
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:46945:135"/> out of hearing, but to one that is with us, and by us, when we are praying.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Faith in Gods omniſcience is alſo <note place="margin">2 In Gods om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience.</note> required in prayer. Thus <hi>David</hi> in his, and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in his, and <hi>Solomon</hi> in his prayer, look at God as one that <hi>tryeth the heart and the reynes:</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 16. 19. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. And faith in prayer cometh not to bring light to God, but rather to borrow light from him in all the buſineſſe of praier. It knowes his all-ſeeing eye, as well as his all-hearing eare. Faith maketh a ſincere heart the more free and bold with God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it eyeth him as one who is privy to all it hath to think or ſpeak in prayer. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more terrible to ſinners thoughts in their wayes, then that God ſeeth them. But nothing more comfortable to godly ones then this perſwaſion, that now they are before an all-ſeeing one; they are glad that they ſerve ſuch a Maſter, and ſpeak to ſuch a father, who doth throughly know them, and watchfully eyeth them. The ſuppliants of God have ſecret things, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret corners to commit to the eares of God, and oh, how well is it for them in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme that they may pray to God <hi>which ſeeth in ſecret! Matth.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Pray to thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in ſecret,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt.)</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants are to ſeek Gods face about matters carryed on by Gods and their own enemies, ſecretly and ſlyly, and had need eye the Lord as one who ſeeth what is contrived
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:46945:135"/> and done in the dark: yea, ſometimes they are ſo ſorely aſſailed, and charged by the wily enemies of their ſoules, that they have no way left them, but to appeale in prayer to the Lords all-ſeeing eye, to judge of the falſe charges of men, and divels; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of their corrupted tempted conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, accuſing them when they ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, diſquieted when they ſhould reſt in God; Hence, <hi>why art thou ſo ſad O my ſoul, and why art thou diſquieted within me? trust ſtill in God. Pſal.</hi> 42. 5. and <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>Deep calleth to deep.</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 8. <hi>My prayer ſhall bee to the God of my life.</hi> That <hi>Tepilla,</hi> or appeale prayerwiſe unto the Lord as one that heareth, where the right lieth, helped much.

Faith in Gods all-ſufficiency is requiſite, <note place="margin">3 In Gods all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency.</note> wherefore Chriſt teaching us to pray, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to look at God, as one <hi>whoſe is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, Mat.</hi> 6. 9, 13. compared. Hence, <hi>the loweſt room, and one days reſidence in Gods houſe of prayer, is deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to David.

None are more ſenſible of their utter inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to withſtand the force and guile of their ſoules enemies, and ſo need ſuch a faith the more: yea, the truth is, true ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants uſe not to ſeek of God this or that ſo much, as God and Chriſt in that which they ſeek of him; God in a ſpouſe, in a friend, in liberty, in health, in ordinances, in comforts, and the like; and therefore they muſt needs eye the Lord as all in all, and all without him to be nothing; yea, in a barren land where no deſirable comforts are; and can then in ſeeking him by faith be ſatisfied with him, <hi>as with marrow and fatneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 63. 1, 2, 3, 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Faith in Gods Almightineſſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in prayer. <hi>Paul,</hi> who <hi>bowed his knees</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4 In Gods Almightineſs.</note> (or prayed) unto the <hi>Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 14. hee looketh on him, as one who was <hi>able to do exceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly above all that we can ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, ver.</hi> 20. So <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> in his prayer, argueth by faith with God thus, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 6.) <hi>And in thy hand is not there power and might?</hi> that is, there is. So <hi>Jeremy</hi> in his prayer, Chap. 32. 16, 17. <hi>I prayed unto the</hi>
                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:46945:136"/> 
                     <hi>Lord, ſaying, Ah Lord, behold thou haſt made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and outſtretched arm, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too hard for thee.</hi> Sometimes Gods ſuppliants are put hard to it in the courſe of their prayers; the laſt grain of their faith and patience ſeemeth to be put into the ſcale: their preſſures are ſuch, that they even ſqueeze them to the laſt drop of their faith and patience; there appeareth but ſome ſmall ſpark thereof under the aſhes: they ſeem to ceaſe in ſome fainting fits, to be even departing, onely ſome gaſping, panting ſymptomes left of life therein; namely, ſome workings of faith in Gods Almightineſſe, that he is yet able to help and ſuccour them. A may be, a poſſibility in reſpect of Gods Almightineſſe, is eyed by faith, and that carryeth them out in prayer. Sometimes the very faith of Gods ſuppliants is at a ſtand, at a <hi>non plus,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Gods will, it is an [if] to them whether he will help; yet they beleeve he can help, and therefore pray; as hee did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Lord [if] thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean:</hi> and ſuch a faith in the Lords Almightineſſe doth great things by prayer: For hence that, <hi>I will, be thou clean,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>&amp; immediately his leproſie was clenſed. v.</hi> 3. He who prayeth in faith of Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſhall have beyond his faith the benefit of his gracious and energetical will. So the Centurion in his prayer to Chriſt believeth
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:46945:137"/> that if he but will his ſervants cure, hee can work it, he can even command it by his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne word. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 8. <hi>Speak the word onely, and my ſervant ſhall be whole.</hi> He is not ſure that he will give out that energati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call word, but <hi>if he would but ſpeak the word,</hi> he concludeth that hee hath power over all deſirable bleſſings, <hi>as ſervants at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand even as his ſouldiers were at his beck, v.</hi> 9, 10. And Chriſt approveth of this his faith in his ſoveraigne power, ſaying, <hi>Verily, I have not found ſo great faith, no, not in Iſrael.</hi> So the man mentioned, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. he maketh a requeſt to Chriſt for his child, but at firſt queſtioned Chriſts power, ſaying, <hi>If thou canſt doe any thing, help us;</hi> and ſo long his requeſt took not; but being quickned up by Chriſts word to faith in his power, that hee could doe any thing for them, and to expect any thing from him in ſuch a way of believing, <hi>if thou canst believe,</hi> (namely, that I can doe any thing for you) <hi>all things are poſſible to him that</hi> ſo <hi>believeth;</hi> then the man cryeth out with teares, <hi>Lord I believe,</hi> (namely, that thou canſt do any thing for us) and ſo get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the bleſſing he prayed for: where pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are put up in faith, believing all things are poſſible to the Lord believed in, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable upon believing in him; there all things are poſſible and attainable to ſuch a faiths-requeſt. Sometimes the ſuppliants of God deale with God in prayer about
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:46945:137"/> intricacies, where the determinations of the will of God ſeeme or are hid, and obſcure, yea for ſuch good things as come within the reach of his power; and herein it were ſad with them, if faith in Gods power might not, or did not relieve them. Yea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they deal with God about caſes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord cometh to expreſſe his will and mind to the contrary, and yet faith in Gods Almightineſſe putteth words into their mouthes, and biddeth, and incourageth them to ſpeak, and to pray to him, and to try it out with him, even in ſuch caſes. When God telleth <hi>Moſes</hi> that <hi>he will ſmite the people, and diſinherit them. Num.</hi> 14. 11, 12. Yet becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> believed the greatneſſe of Gods power, which might elſe be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, hee pleadeth that the nations will ſay, that becauſe the Lord was not able to bring them into the promiſed land, therefore he ſlew them, and then betaketh him to this hold; <hi>Let the power of my Lord be great, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as thou haſt ſpoken: the Lord is long ſuffering and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity, &amp;c.</hi> He looked at him as now able to fulfill the other part of his revealed will, even to be a God <hi>pardoning his peoples ſins.</hi> This ſet the <hi>Ninivites</hi> a praying, when yet God had ſaid, <hi>yet forty dayes and Niniveh ſhal be deſtroyed. Jonah</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5. Yet for ought any knew to the contrary, God might ſhew them mercy, <hi>verſe</hi> 8, 9. <hi>who can tell if God may not turne and repent of his fierce anger,</hi>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:46945:138"/> 
                     <hi>that we periſh not,</hi> and their prayers tooke effect, verſe 10 <hi>God repented of the evill that he had ſaid.</hi> Beſides, true ſeekers of God are continually ſenſible of mighty, adverſe powers of darkneſſe againſt them, ſo that if they had not faith in Gods almightineſs overmatching thoſe powers, they would not pray without ceaſing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Faith in the gracious nature, and diſpoſition of God, as in his love, mercy, bounty, compaſſion, long-ſuffering, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is required. Nothing more uſuall with the Saints in their prayers mentioned throughout the ſcripture, then to ſet their faith on worke in prayer upon the gracious nature of God. I need not mention the ſcriptures. In this ocean faith can freely ſwim, and bear up all the ſuppliants bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and packets. In this holy chancery court, and court of grace, it can have right in any caſes, which concerne the ſoule. Nothing more ſutable to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and thirſting deſires of ſuppliants, and nothing more ſweet, and ſatisfying, then the marrow and fatneſſe of Gods loving kindneſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 1. to 5. <hi>The upright remember the love of the Lord more then wine,</hi> Cant. 14. A poore ſuppliant ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth here by an eye of faith the true riches which his ſoule needeth, and that it is here ready for him, that God is rich in mercy to all that call upon him. So did <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 86. 41. This is a ſpirituall all-heale
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46945:138"/> to the poore diſeaſed, wounded ſoule, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God for cure: therein it ſeeth, and eyeth the particular ſalves, that are moſt ſutable to the ſeverall ſores of which it complaineth: when the people of God are toſſed with tempeſts of troubles, and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as they were <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44. 11. yet they eye this as a ſweet and ſafe harbour; if they can but put in here, they are ſheltred in all weathers; if they can but caſt the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of faith and hope here, they can ride it out ſecurely, and without hurt or loſſes from any windes which blow:</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Faith in Gods ſimplicity is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <note place="margin">6 In Gods ſimplicity.</note> 
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> in his prayer looketh at God as alwayes acting, and all act, one whoſe eyes were open night and day. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 29 ſo the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 65<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. and thou that art hearing (ever hearing) prayers, <hi>to thee ſhall all fleſh come.</hi> The like faith in the eternity, and immutability of God, and in his faithfulneſſe in what he is to his poore redeemed ones, and in what he ſaith to them, and doth for them in a way of grace and favour, is needfull. <hi>Hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakuk</hi> in his prayer maketh uſe of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of God, Hab. 1. 12. <hi>Art not thou from everlaſting, oh Lord my God, my holy one? wee ſhall not dye.

The ſuppliants themſelves, and their caſes vary much, and ſuffer many changes, but faith in theſe incourageth them to hold on in inceſſant prayer to the Lord. We might have inſtanced in the particulars of faiths improvements of the relative nature of God, in prayer: as that of a Father, of a Saviour, Redeemer, and the like, as is often mentioned in Scripture, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 8. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 63. 15, 16, 17. and 64. 8. &amp;c. but I ſhall forbear: proceed we therefore <note place="margin">7.

Chriſt is able to ſave ſuch to the uttermoſt which come unto God by him. Out of Chriſt <hi>God is a conſuming fire,</hi> and if we eye him as ſuch a one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wee are driven from him rather than drawn to him. <hi>Daniel</hi> craveth all things <hi>for the Lords ſake,</hi> Dan. 9. 17. <hi>David</hi> requeſteth mercies of the Lord for his words ſake, or as in 1 Chron. 11. 9. for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſake; the ſaints of old looked in their prayers towards the temple. 1 King. 8. 29, 30. 35, 38. So Jonah chap. 2. 4. Now the temple was a type of Chriſt, Chriſt ſpake <hi>of the temple of his body,</hi> Joh. 2. It was not enough for the Iſraelites to cry out of wounds, nor for <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray with them, or for them, but they muſt <hi>look</hi>

                     <hi>to the brazen Serpent,</hi> Numb. 21. 7, 8, 9. which in Joh. 3. 13, 14, 15. is made a type of Chriſt: Chriſt is the altar where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wee offer all our ſpirituall ſacrifices, if acceptable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 12. And if we doe in offering them but touch this bleſſed altar by faith, that ſanctifieth them. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 37. The beſt incenſe of our prayers needeth ſprinkling with Chiſts bloud.

                  <p>A third branch of faith required in <note place="margin">8 In Gods promiſes.</note> prayer, is faith in Gods promiſes; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſuch promiſes as doe reſpect our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall and particular caſes and complaints. <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> in his prayer maketh uſe of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table promiſe, reſpecting the preſent caſe about which he then beſought the Lord, 2 Chron. 20. 6, 7, 8, 9. ſaying, if when <hi>evill cometh upon us, as the ſword, &amp;c. we ſtand before this houſe, and in thy preſence, and cry in our afflictions unto the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, then thou wilt hear and help.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is to ſeek the Lord for mercy upon his houſe, he improveth a promiſe of God made to that end, 2 Sam. 7 27. <hi>For thou O God haſt revealed it unto thy ſervants, ſaying, I will build thee an houſe: therefore hath thy ſervant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.</hi> The Lord is ſo <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:46945:140"/> as in <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> ſo in <hi>truth, Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. that at every paths end, in the way of grace, and race of godlineſſe he hath placed ſome well of ſalvation, ſome ſpring of conſolation, quickning and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Chriſt to goe therein without fainting. All his Ordinances, and precepts, have their promiſes annexed to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obſervance thereof, and no one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance hath more gracious promiſes made to the conſcionable attendance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon then this of prayer.</p>
                  <p>This of prayer; as it is that which in ſpeciall putteth much honour upon God, ſo the Lord hath honoured it with many goodly, glorious, incouraging promiſes; now faith maketh uſe of this bleſſed treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, bequeathed in the Lords Teſtament to prayer, or to his ſuppliants prayings: Faith wiſely layeth out and beſtoweth this holy ſtock, here and there, in this and that caſe, as need requireth: hardly any prayer caſe to bee ſuppoſed, but there are promiſes here and there ſcattered in the word of God, which ſpeak to that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry caſe, if not directly yet by neceſſary conſequences: Now by that grace of Faith, the godly make ſutable improvement thereof, and where the caſe requireth, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch ſpirituall concluſions from them, as put them upon the pleading ſuch holy maximes before the Lord, the Lord ſeeth it meet to bound the peoples deſires with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46945:140"/> theſe holy limits of his promiſes, and it is faith that helpeth us to keep within compaſſe in our prayers. And ſurely there is no language more ſweet and acceptable to God then to ſpeak to him in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in this holy language of his ſpirit and word, in his own language: if we ſpeak in our prayers no otherwiſe then the Lord himſelfe ſpeaketh in his promiſes, there ſhall bee a ſweet conſort of voice begun by the ſpirit in the promiſes, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the ſpirit of faith in the Saints prayers, and anſwered by God in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The laſt branch of faith required in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <note place="margin">9. In Gods providences.</note> was faith in God his providences; the Saints in their prayers mentioned in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have uſed thus by faith to improve the providence of God, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 4, 5. <hi>Our fathers called upon thee, and were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</hi> Iſai. 64. The reall reſpects which the Lord beares to his peoples prayers, are practically demonſtrated in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, providences of mercy reſpecting prayer caſes, are but the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God made thereto, acted and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Every ſuch providence is an Oracle of God inſtructing or incouraging us. Faith is a ſpirituall recorder in the ſoule and conſcience ſanctified, it regiſtreth, writeth and noteth downe by the finger of the ſpirit on the table of the heart, ſuch obſervable and uſefull paſſages; and faith
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46945:141"/> calleth for conſcience to read them over, as need requireth. There are no caſes now, but what in ſubſtance have been heretofore, there is nothing new under the Sun. And the Lord in like caſes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vary, but ever carrieth it like himſelfe, ſo that faith makes great advantage hereof in prayer; the ſpirit of God hee leadeth ſuppliants in the ſame track of holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts for the ſubſtance of them, and what wonder if the ſame anſwers, and iſſues are, may be, muſt be by faith expected: preſidents in prayer caſes, as they are rules to us, ſo are they arguments with God in our holy pleadings with him in our prayers for his mercy. It is ſo with men in their Courts and pleas, Preſidents in ſuch and ſuch a Kings reigne, in ſuch a ſuite, thus and thus iſſued, according to ſuch or ſuch a Statute, not repealed, are caſting matters in law ſuits; and ſo it is verily in our ſuites in heavens Court, for this or that reliefe which wee crave: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents of providences improved by faith are a currant Goſpel plea.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing propounded comes <note place="margin">The worke of faith in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> now to be handled, namely what is the worke and buſineſſe of faith in prayer?

This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace of faith in his heart, was the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits inſtrument to teach him. Faith is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>wiſdom of the juſt, Luke</hi> 1. 17. the wiſdome of juſtified perſons by Chriſt, to which they were to be converted, there ſpoken of: and as other wiſdome, ſo this in ſpeciall is profitable to direct our mindes and mouthes: It is faith which giveth the ſoul the trueſt ſurvey which it hath faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made of its emptineſſe and needineſſe. It is faith which moſt fully and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly informeth the ſoul of the fulneſſe and freeneſſe of the riches of Grace in God and Chriſt, and of his ſutableneſs to us, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering our caſes and conditions: It is faith that telleth the ſoul of its intereſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements in the mercies of God, and merits of Chriſt, and in the Covenant of grace, and any particular branch thereof, ſo far as the ſame doth concern its perfect ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes about which the ſoule comes to God in Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Faith in Prayer acteth as a Queen, and <note place="margin">2. It injoineth.</note>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:46945:142"/> (as I may ſay) a mother grace, to order, and injoyn, and excite each praying grace unto its proper work therein. When Faith is ſtirring, it doth in a manner ſpeak, and charge Deſire to do its office; reach out thy hand, open thy mouth wide, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large thy ſelf (O Deſire) to crave theſe and theſe mercies which the ſoul needeth, which the Lord is ready to give. And Love, do thou the like, never a more lovely object pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to thee from one who ſo dearly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the ſoul wherein thou art. Zeal, be thou fervent, put an edge upon Deſire and Love; the caſe ſo requireth, the mercies are neer, its pity they ſhould be loſt for want of putting to a little more ſtrength to wreſtle for them. Humility, ſtoop thou the heart, fall down, be low and vile before one that is ſo glorious. Fear, awe thou the heart, let it tremble in the preſence of the holy One of Iſrael. Joy, do thou enlarge the heart in the ſenſe of mercies already got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by prayer, and more mercies are at hand. Hope, ſtand thou on tiptoe, and look up, and look out; for verily mercy is not far off: the Lord is neer ſuch ſecret mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and whiſpers of faith that are in the ſouls of Gods ſuppliants; their ſpirits are incouraged and moved variouſly to act in prayer from that faith which they have in the Lord when it is exerciſed. Look as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> faith in the love of God towards him, occaſioned &amp; made that ſpeech in his ſoul,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:46945:142"/> when to praiſe God; ſo that <hi>David</hi> from the ſtrength of his faith therein ſpeaketh to his ſoul, <hi>And all that is within him to praiſe his Name,</hi> Pſalm 103. 1. The like ſpeech doth faith occaſion in a gracious heart, when to pray, requiring all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſame to be imployed in furthring the work. So when <hi>David</hi> is to make his prayer to the God of his life, in faith that God will command loving kindneſs to him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 42. 8. here is a charge given in his heart to attend it patiently and hopefully, and diſtempers are commanded to ſtand by the while, <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Faith in Prayer is a moderation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate <note place="margin">3. It doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate.</note> and rectifie the ſouls pleas; yea, to dictate Arguments to back thoſe holy pleas. Prayers of Faith uſe to be pleading pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, filled and carryed on in lively reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the Lord. And becauſe oft-times the ſpirit of a Suppliant may be even non-pluſt almoſt, and not know how to carry it on, by reaſon of ſecret cavils rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the heart, whether from Satan, or diſtruſt, or otherwiſe; Faith then ſtepping forth, and whiſpering ſome ſpiritual and ſutable anſwers, cleareth up the miſt upon the Spirit, and the miſtake and ſophiſme, and ſo the ſoul is a freſh carryed on in his pleading with God. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 77. 7. <hi>Will the Lord caſt off? &amp;c.</hi> this was ſecretly whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered by diſtruſt, as if God would caſt him off: <hi>but will he do it for ever?</hi> and ſo <hi>ver.</hi>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:46945:143"/> 8, 9. <hi>David</hi> his ſpirit was pinched in theſe reaſonings and cavils; at preſent he could not poſitively anſwer that God would not do ſo: the cavil of diſtruſt became a real queſtion to his tempted, deſerted ſpirit, by reaſoning ſo much with that whilſt he was crying to the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 1 but faith gave light to the caſe, and upon diſcovery hee perceived that theſe were but cavils of an infirm ſpirit of his own. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. The caſe is reſolved and determined through the help and light of Faith exerciſed, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſtanding up, which before ſate ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; and he concluded this was his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. Faith is a Second to the ſoul in its holy wreſtlings and pleadings with God to ſuccour it in its ſuits, both in point of aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance perſwading with the heart, that the Lord will prepare the heart to ſeek him, and ſo the rather to prevail, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 17. And in point of Aſſurance, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 15. it is the ſpeech of faith, <hi>We have what we ask of God.</hi> It is as ſure as if it were already gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And ſo in point of Acceptance, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>We know he heareth.</hi> ver. 7. Now when at any time the ſpirit of a Suppliant begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to give out, when any fainting fit is upon it, then faith reneweth the charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord, taketh up the holy weapons which the ſpirit of the Saints began to lay by, the Arguments which it was ready to forgo, and now the ſoul gathers up it ſelfe afreſh, and plyeth the Lord with renewed
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:46945:143"/> ſtrength of holy requeſts: at this paſſe was <hi>Jonah chap.</hi> 2. 4, 7. he ſaid, <hi>he was caſt out, yet would look again to the Lord;</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 7. when fainting, and when faith minding him afreſh of ſomething in the Lord, he is revived, and ſends up many Supplications to him. What, give out? wil Faith ſay, nay fie for ſhame. It claps the ſoul on the back, (as I may ſay) and bids it chear up, wreſtle one bout more, purſue once again; it may be, nay, it is likely thou wilt prevail, nay, thou ſhalt indeed prevail.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Faith in prayer is an Agent for the <note place="margin">4. It pleadeth</note> ſoul to improve and plead all the foregoing principles, and ſpiritual Topick places men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. That of Gods gracious diſpoſition it is a large field and very fruitful in prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Arguments, when improved by faith: ſo is that of God his All-ſufficiency, All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſs, Eternity, Immutability: and ſo is that of Chriſt conſidered in his Offices, Merit, Mediation, and Interceſſion: the Promiſes of God likewiſe are ſeveral heads of holy pleas: Faith improveth them wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſeaſonably, and ſutably, as the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the ſame require. It would bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them all, in and through the Lord Jeſus, for the ſouls ſuccour and ſupport in this Ordinance of Prayer, verifying that <hi>Iſai.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Drawing water out of the wells of Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 Finally, Faith in prayer becometh (as it were) the common pledge between the <note place="margin">5. It underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</note>

Faith undertakes to become bound, and to be a pawne to the ſoul, that the Lord for his part will do what is meet, and what becometh him for the ſoul. And againe it ingageth it ſelfe to the Lord, that by his help the ſoul ſhall attend to its duty, which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it. See <hi>Pſalm</hi> 55. 3. <hi>Davids</hi> faith you ſee there, pawneth its credit that the Lord will not, ſhall not ſay him nay; <hi>My voice ſhalt thou hear, O Lord:</hi> and then faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſeth on <hi>Davids</hi> behalf, that he will and ſhall rightly order his prayer, and ſo wait and leave it with the Lord, <hi>and unto thee will I direct my prayer, and look up.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. In the third place we come to conſider of ſome uſeful Helps unto ſincere Suppliants <note place="margin">Helps to ſaith in prayer.</note> Faith in prayer. The Helps and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to faith in Prayer may be ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Let us take and make all holy advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the leaſt <hi>may be</hi> of Mercy, where on <note place="margin">1. Improve e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very may be of mercy.</note> we may ground an expectation of a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſucceſſe and anſwer of our prayers. We may, yea muſt do thus. Meek ones muſt ſeek the Lord, hoping for his mercy when there is but a <hi>may be</hi> of being hid from the Lords anger, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 3. Thus did the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivites: no body could tell they ſhould bee delivered, nor aſſure them of mercy if they did ſue for it; but yet none could tell
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:46945:144"/> the contrary, none could ſay peremptorily they ſhould periſh without remedy. If it be but a <hi>Who can tell,</hi> it is a ground of mighty prayers, and may cheriſh a ſpark of hope therein of ſucceſſe, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> muſt lift up his prayer, albeit it be but a may be, that God would hear the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſpeeches of <hi>Rabſhekah,</hi> againſt which he was to bend his prayers on <hi>Iſraels</hi> behalf, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 4. A very peradventure of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in prayer will ſet <hi>Moſes</hi> a praying, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 30. No Scripture telleth thee that thou art a caſt-away, many Scriptures give thee grounds of a may be at leaſt of ſalvation. Let that therefore raiſe thee, though troubled ſore, to look and wait for a gracious anſwer of thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>

Wee may not reſt in mercies and bleſſings received, but we may and muſt be incouraged from them to reach after and waite for more, if we never had taſted of his goodneſs to us, when we ſought him, yet were we to expect and waite for his gracious anſwer: but <hi>taſting and ſeeing how good the Lord is</hi> by experience, it is then a bleſſed thing to <hi>truſt in him.</hi> Pſ. 34. 4. 8. We may well truſt him and reſt on him as a God hearing prayers, when we have tryed him to be ſuch a one; or elſe it will be a ſhame, if ſpeaking it in his word that he is ſuch a one, and then ſpeaking it over ſenſibly in his workes that hee is ſuch a one, yet hee cannot be believed. If any, ſurely ſuch as by experience know the name of God (have proofe of that or any other title or Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute or word of his wherein hee maketh himſelfe knowne to us) they will truſt in him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 10. Gratious anſwers of prayer given to the Saints, are precious pledges of our intereſt in the covenant of grace, and in God as our God, and ſo
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:46945:145"/> we are to look at them, and be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by them, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 9. We are alſo to quicken up our confident expectations of a gracious iſſue of our prayers from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther experiences therein: ſo the Saints uſed to do in their prayers mentioned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 1. 13, 14. and oft elſewhere; for indeed the Lord in giving anſwers of Grace to any of his children, hath regard to the good and encouragement of them all: that which the Lord did for, and ſpake to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating, wreſtling <hi>Jacob, (Gen.</hi> 32.) hee eyed others that were to come after him therein. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12. 4. <hi>He had power over the Angel, &amp;c. and there he</hi> (that Angel the Lord himſelf) <hi>ſpake with [us,]</hi> not with him alone. The regard which the Lord hath to the prayers of deſtitute ones, is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and recorded for the generation to come, to make a comfortable uſe thereof, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 102. 17, 18. if one of Gods choſen ones fare well in their holy approaches to God, the Prophet will put it plurally in the concluſion; he draweth from thence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 4. (the former part of the verſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the latter part) <hi>we ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the goodneſs of thy houſe.</hi>

                  <p>We will and muſt needs confeſſe, that Chriſts prayers were without exception, and that the <hi>Father alwayes heard him,</hi> John 11. How well is it then for us that the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus hath with acceptance prevented us, and theſe mercies are already begged by Chriſt, and granted of God to our hands? Surely, the Lord hath heard Chriſt in the deſires which hee as Mediatour expreſſed to the Lord, that we and our ſervices, and ſo our prayers might be accepted; of which that in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 49. 8. is prophetically ſpoken, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. we may well expect that in our holy approaches and makings out to God for mercy, we come in a time of acceptance, ſince the Lord hath heard Chriſt beſpeaking of it: if the Lord the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honour the Lord Jeſus, becauſe in the dayes of his <hi>fleſh he made interceſſion for Tranſgreſſours, Iſaiah</hi> 13. 12. <hi>(therefore ſhall he divide the ſpoil, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe he did ſo) ſurely we may well expect the ſucceſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

Look as whilſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were <hi>praying without, the Prieſt was offering Incenſe within the Temple,</hi> Luke 1. 9. 10. So is Chriſt in that glorious Temple above appearing before God for us, whilſt we are a praying.

A Judge, a man, comes off to hear a poor ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants requeſt; and will not God, a Father, do much more for his? An unjuſt Judg hears,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:46945:151"/> and will not a juſt and righteous God hear the cryes of his poor ones? One that was a hater and diſregarder of men, and of his own name, yet hears; and will not God and Chriſt hear, whoſe delight is to be with men? <hi>Prov,</hi> 8. One that was utterly averſe from hearing, <hi>[He would not hear:]</hi> one to whom asking was a trouble, <hi>[This widow troubleth me]</hi> yet at length grants the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of her which ſought to him. How much more will the Lord, to whom prayer is a delight, and whoſe property it is to be hearing, (even ready to hear) prayers? ſurely he will hearken to his ſuppliants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts much more.

He will ſurely fulfil his peoples deſires. One that in granting his Petitioners deſire, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to avoid diſquiet, <hi>(Leſt ſhe ſhould weary him out with her out-cryes)</hi> he hearkens; and will not God, who delighteth in mercy, do much more for his precious ones? One that is ſolicited by (a certain widow) one no way allyed to him, (coming to him without any other Interceſſour to plead her cauſe) yet he cannot deny her Petition: and can or will the Lord deny his own deare children, which come to him in the name of him in
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:46945:151"/> whom he is well pleaſed; yea, and have the Lord himſelfe to intercede for him?</p>
                  <p>Touching the laſt thing propounded, very briefly. The Marks of one praying in faith <note place="margin">Marks of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in faith.</note> are theſe.</p>

If he pray without ceaſing when yet there are ſo many things ſometimes which may ſeem to occaſion ceaſing to pray, ſave that he prayeth in faith.

When the Lord is long ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, yet we will not be ſilent, but plead, <hi>How long Lord?</hi> Pſal. 13. 1, 2. When denyed of God as the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as if we had no part in the mercy we ask, it were not for us, yet we continue asking, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 25. 26, 27.

                  <head>CHAP. V. Of Humility required in Prayer.</head>
                  <p>WE have entred upon the diſcourſe of things propounded touching the conditions required for the inceſſant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the duty of prayer, and have diſpatched the firſt, namely, Faith. And now we are to ſpeak of the ſecond condition thereto required, and that is Humility. <hi>It is the deſire of the humble which the Lord hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, Pſal.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>and his people that pray are to humble themſelves, and then the Lord promiſeth them hearing.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 14. But <note place="margin">Humility in prayer conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth.</note> for our better proceeding in handling this condition of prayer, Let us conſider,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Wherein that Humility which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in prayer doth conſiſt?</item>
                     <item>2. When Humility expreſſed in prayer may be diſcerned to be ſaving?</item>
                     <item>3. Why this Humility is required to prayer?</item>
                     <item>4. What are uſefull helps and means fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering ſuch humility in prayer?</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>To the firſt, we ſay, Humility required in prayer conſiſteth in theſe ſix or ſeven things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In low thoughts of our ſelves to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt <note place="margin">1 In low thoughts of our ſelves as unmeet to pray.</note> or ſet about ſuch a duty. When wee are going about it, we judge our ſelves moſt
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:46945:153"/> unmeet and unworthy in our ſelves to ſpeak to the Lord; as we are imployed in praying, ſtill the ſerious and ſenſible thoughts of our owne worthleſneſſe dwells with us, and works on us. That juſtified ſuppliant men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 13, 14. ſtandeth a far off and would ſcarce lift up his eyes to heaven, he thinks he is not worthy to come nearer: let others goe as high as they pleaſe; as for himſelfe, hee will take the loweſt roome in Gods houſe. It is more then he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of to be admitted to come there at all, and heaven is too glorious a place in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for him, a wretch as hee hath been to be ſo bold; he hath ſinned againſt heaven, it is better for him to look on the duſt, yea, to kiſſe and lick the duſt. In the words which the wiſeman ſpeaketh prayer-wiſe unto Chriſt) that <hi>Itheil,</hi> he that was his God, and that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>call,</hi> that mighty one,) <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 1, 7, 8, 9. You ſee how humbly hee prefaceth in his ſpeech (ſo far as directed to him in way of prayer) as <hi>verſe</hi> 2, 3. hee profeſſeth hee is more bruitiſh then any man; and hath not the underſtanding of a man, ſo unfit and unworthy doth he ſee himſelfe, to ſpeak either of Chriſt in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive way, as <hi>verſe</hi> 4, 5, 6. or to Chriſt in a ſupplicating way, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8, 9. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples having been at praier with Chriſt, they ſee ſo much weight in the duty, and ſo much excellency in the due exerciſe of the gift and grace of Chriſt in prayer, that they look
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:46945:153"/> at themſelves as moſt unfit to pray as they ought, and therefore intreat his help and direction, <hi>Lord teach us to pray. Luke</hi> 11. 1. The Pſalmiſt beginneth his prayer in a kind of expoſtulation with God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 1, 2. and preſſing of God with examples of his mercy to others in like caſes, <hi>verſe</hi> 4, 5. But if thou think hee is too bold with God, and keepeth not his due diſtance, hee will profeſſe that for his owne part, <hi>he is a worm and no man, verſe</hi> 6, 7. he judged himſelfe, as infinitely unworthy to ſtand upon termes with God, ſo even unfit to make compariſon with others, <hi>verſe</hi> 5, 6. <hi>But I am a worm, and no man:</hi> what ever our fathers were, yet I look at my ſelfe, as fitter to creep on the earth, and feed onely upon the duſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the guilt of ſinne laid upon me, (for if you apply it to Chriſt the antitype, God <hi>laid upon him the iniquity of us all, Iſai.</hi> 53. 6. but we intend it of the Pſalmiſt rather himſelfe:) then as a man to lift up my ſelfe to heaven; and therefore am juſtly made the reproach of men, <hi>ibid.</hi> No ſooner do the Saints eſſay to draw near unto God, but the beames of the glory of God reflect upon the faces of their ſouls, which doe thus awe and abaſe them; they ſee in the glaſſe of that excellency their owne vileneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In abaſed thoughts of our ſelves <note place="margin">2 In low thoughts of our ſelves when heard.</note> when we do get any thing of the Lord by prayer. True it is, humble ones do ſpeed beſt of all others in prayer: but yet, as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:46945:154"/> of prayer found them, ſo they leave them humble. When <hi>Abraham</hi> hath gained upon the Lord by prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 26. yet then, nay then eſpecially is <hi>Abraham</hi> loweſt and vileſt in his owne eſteeme, then <hi>verſe</hi> 27. he ſaith, and ſeeth <hi>he is duſt and aſhes.</hi> He then conſidereth what he is in himſelfe, whence he came, and whither he muſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the favour which hee findeth with the Lord; he knoweth no cauſe which ſhould move the Lord to give any anſwer of mercy to ſo meane an one as himſelfe, but his rich grace, (What is in duſt to move re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects in God to it?) and ſecretly preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it as a plea to continue ſuch undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved mercy to ſuch an one, from that which moved the Lord to begin to reſpect his prayer. Thus <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 34. 4 when hee had gained by his prayer, and God was found of him, yet <hi>verſe</hi> 6. hee putteth an humble Emphaſis upon the matter, <hi>this poore man cryed.</hi> That <hi>they, verſe</hi> 5. (even bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men then he, ſuch as had walked worthy of God, and of his grace,) looked unto the Lord in prayer, and were incouraged by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of favour, was no wonder; but that this <hi>poor man,</hi> that he poor wretch, as he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth himſelfe, one that (as in the title of the Pſalm) ſaith, he <hi>changed his favour and was not like himſelfe,</hi> in that caſe at <hi>Gath,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 13, yet he to cry unto the Lord, and be heard, this is a wonder of grace to him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Ephraim</hi> hath prayed for turning grace
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46945:154"/> from God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18. and is anſwered, <hi>v.</hi> 19. then is he abaſed, yea more abaſed in his own ſight then before. When the Church upon her requeſt is drawn unto her beloved, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. then ſhe cryeth out of her blackneſſe. <hi>verſe</hi> 5. Humbleſt Chriſtians are the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and healthieſt in ſpirit, and as ſhowres and blaſts of affliction and temptation doe not much annoy them, ſo neither doe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming gleames and ſhines of mercy diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per them, ſtill they are humble; they are ſquare men, nothing comes amiſſe to them, they will fall right which way ever they are caſt, if lowly. Look as veſſells whoſe ſayls are filled, if well ballaſted, they run a more ſteady courſe; ſo is it here with the Saints, when they pray with full ſayled joy of faith, yet when this holy ballaſt of humility is in the hold of the heart, and not meerly aloft in ſhew above decks, appearing to men: they are not ſoon lifted up with every good ſucceſſe they meet with, but keep low, and deep, and carry it evenly with the Lord, as humbly, if not more humbly then before. The Saints know well they are but beggers, and ſtand in need of much; they prayſe not their good prayers, but their good Maſter for the almes of grace which they get: <hi>Not unto us,</hi> and becauſe once was too little to ſet forth their owne unworthineſſe of any mercy, they repeat it againe, <hi>not unto us, but to thy Name give glory, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 115. 1. Liitle cauſe to be proud of a trade or art of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46945:155"/> ſuch holy begging, albeit through the bounty of God it proves gainfull.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In affectionate amplifications of <note place="margin">3 In affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of our vileneſſe, and of Gods grace.</note> our owne vileneſſe, and Gods mercy and excellency. As beggars which uſe to make very lamentable relations of their owne mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, but yet giving their benefactors all their titles to the full. So thoſe in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 1. ingeminate the expreſſion of their owne utter unworthineſſe. <hi>Not unto us, not unto us.</hi> And the Publican in his prayer ſpeaks of himſelfe, as a ſinner, none elſe ſuch a one as he, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13, 14. So the Prodigall in his requeſt to his father, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth his extreame and unparallel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſinne, and unworthineſſe. <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 18, 19. So thoſe converts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18, 19. Do the like: ſuch like amplifications being as ſo many forcible arguments in their prayer, with themſelves, to further compunction, and contrition in them; and with God, to further their participation of the benefit of his compaſſions. Out of the abundant heart-abaſement the mouth ſpeaks. As pride is large in ſpeaking for ſelfe, ſo is humility in declaring againſt ſelfe.</p>

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46945:155"/> nature, temptations of Sathan, &amp;c. which are far more grievous. That we have ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned loſſes in ſoule that are almoſt inrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, loſt the goodly patrimony in our firſt parents of Gods favour and image, which never can be ſufficiently bewailed; yea hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have loſt that little light, and life, and comfort of grace through ſome ill courſe we tooke ſince the Lord ſet us up againe, and truſted us with a new ſtock of grace; yea, are ſtrangely runne behind hand with God; yea, we are extreamely in debt by our ſinne to divine juſtice; yea, we are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with many ſpiritual diſeaſes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, and ſorely wounded in our ſpirits, through ſome ſad foils of the enemies of our ſouls, and in all wee are utterly inſufficient to recover our ſelves, yea, and helpleſſe, and ſhiftleſſe, in the very uſe of ſuch means as might tend thereunto. Wee ſee indeed, that if we could believe, that would ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour us, but yet are not able; if wee could ſo earneſtly wreſtle for, and breath after help of God in Chriſt, we might have relief; but ſee alſo that of our ſelves wee cannot doe ſo much, but as wee are able through the might of God. Wee tell him of our grievances, and plead our miſeries, and ſpread them before him, and his people, if they may move to mercy, and ſo wait his gracious leiſure for the ſame. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> pleads for mercy to him and his people, becauſe <hi>their backſlidings were many.

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:46945:159"/> 18. 12. Nor when ſad countenances and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected looks are adjoyned in ſuch ſolemne times of prayer. There is an hypocritical affected ſadneſſe of countenance charged upon thoſe falſe hearted profeſſors in their dayes of faſting and praier, forbidden to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere ones, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 16. No nor when teares and weepings are joyned to ſuch prayers, are they alwayes expreſſions of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving humility therein required: albeit ſome of thoſe were ſincere, yet ſurely ſome of that people which wept ſo ſore, upon that confeſſion of ſins made, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 1. and in that ſolemn time wherein all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to <hi>Miſpeh</hi> to pray, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 5, and there even poured out waters, ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly did they weep on that faſt day, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. were not ſincere therein, but many of them did it from common principles, and not ſaving.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I anſwer, <hi>Affirmatively.</hi> Humility expreſſed in prayer is then ſaving.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When a gracious Chriſtian abaſeth <note place="margin">But 1.

Thus did the <hi>Publican</hi> in his prayer, he <hi>ſmote on his breſt,</hi> and that not to ſeem to be humbled; but as one outward help to himſelf to be abaſed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 13. Hence the concluſion of Chriſt in
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:46945:160"/> ference to the humble manner of ſeeking of Gods face, <hi>He that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted.</hi> The <hi>Phariſee</hi> he layeth all ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials together in his prayer. <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. as did rather tend to lift up his ſpirit, which was high enough in it ſelf, and needed not ſuch ſtirrups. When humility is wrought in prayer, as out of the fire, yea, gained out of much contrary oppoſition, a Chriſtian finding his heart ſenſeleſs, unaffected, and unbroken, he taketh ſuch pains with his heart in prayer, and wreſtles ſo with God and his own ſpirit, that it relenteth, and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and falleth before God. Thus did thoſe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> they ceaſe not bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, and charging their ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neckedneſſe, and unbrokenneſſe ſo deeply upon themſelves, and preſſing the Lord for a more ſerious and through bringing of their hearts to a relenting, repenting frame, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. 18. whilſt that they prevail with God, and their owne ſoules, and are more throughly abaſed, aſhamed, and confounded in their own ſight before the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 When a Chriſtian is in a holy wiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed <note place="margin">2.

That hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Publican</hi> that was ſo aſhamed in his prayer, in the ſenſe of his extreme vileneſs, and unworthineſſe in himſelf, he is juſtified, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13, 14. he thought earth and hell below were more ſutable to his caſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:46945:160"/> and the judgement of God there (and thence looketh downe thitherwards) then heavens glory and grace. Thus that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Suppliant <hi>Ezra</hi> in his prayer profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>he was aſhamed, and bluſheth to lift up his face to heaven, Ezra</hi> 9. 6. Thus the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, and converted Prodigall, he is even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to owne the name of a ſonne; to be called, or be as an hired ſervant is too good for him, he thinketh, and ſpeaketh ſo in his prayer. <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 19. The woman that came to Chriſt, ſhe is even aſhamed to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, to behold his bleſſed counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but <hi>ſtandeth behind him. Luke</hi> 7. 38. And ſhe ſped well in the deſire of her ſoul, for the comfortable manifeſtation of her pardon, ſhee ſecretly ſought for. Saith Chriſt, <hi>verſe</hi> 48, 50. <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. When a man in or upon his prayer <note place="margin">3 A holy awe in and after prayer.</note> is affected and awed with much holy trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling: thus that humble Suppliant in <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13. <hi>He is even afraid to lift up his eyes to heaven,</hi> durſt not doe it, ſuch awfull rayes in the glorious purity, majeſty and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Lord did he behold by an eye of faith, and <hi>he is juſtified therein, verſe</hi> 14. That godly Prophet in his Prayer, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 1, 2. and in the mention of divers things touching God his providence and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, <hi>his belly</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>trembled, and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſſe entered into his bones, verſe</hi> 17. Thence that believing Centurion, after hee
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:46945:161"/> had ſent to Chriſt to intreat his gracious preſence, and coming for the help of his ſervant, as in a holy wiſe jealous of himſelf, and what he had done, whether he, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy an one, had not made too bold with the Lord Jeſus, to deſire him to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his roofe; he ſendeth a ſecond meſſage, therein profeſſing his unworthineſſe that Chriſt ſhould condeſcend ſo far to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſo unworthy an one as he judged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 3. compared with verſe 6, 7.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

Thus the Publican, juſtified in that way of prayer mentioned, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. the maine and in a manner only matter of his deſires was, that God would <hi>be propitious to him a ſinner;</hi> for ſo the Greek word ſignifies, or be reconciled to him, and have mercy on him, in covering all his ſinnes in Chriſt, the favour and mercy of God in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, as a propitiation for ſinnes, is all in all with him. When a child of God is in great afflictions of outward as well as inward man, yet the favourable remembrances, and mercifull reſpects of Chriſt to a poore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſinner, even in tortures, it is all in all. The converted thiefe deſireth not to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or exempted from any juſtly deſerved cenſures of God or man, but onely favour with Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 39, 41, 42. The other wretch was all for his owne eaſe,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:46945:161"/> and for to continue in the world; he careth not for the favour of Chriſt, as ſometimes the Pſalmiſt did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 1, 3. <hi>The lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſſe of God in any condition is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then life;</hi> to live in the love and favour of Chriſt, is more then ten thouſand lives to him: yea, ſo the Lord will be mercifull to him in the maine of his ſoule, hee careth not what becomes of his bodily life, when cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſacrifice the ſame.

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:46945:162"/> yea hee would bee glad to have of the refuſe, and leavings, and ſpare even of hirelings bread. <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 17. <hi>Make mee as one of thy hired ſervants,</hi> namely, in their allowances, as well as ſervices; as one of them, albeit as the meaneſt kitchin-boy, (as it were) the pooreſt, moſt deſpiſed cutter of wood, and drawer of water, &amp;c.

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe prayers put up in and with ſuch humility, they doe ever ſpeed beſt. <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 29. <hi>For this ſaying, go thy waies, the divell is gone out of thy daughter,</hi> for what
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46945:163"/> ſaying? namely, that <hi>verſe</hi> 26. wherein ſhe taketh the name of a dog ſo quietly, and meekly &amp; craveth the very portion of dogs in a manner, the mercies ſlighted by the children: The Lord will not look at what the proud bring to him, but hath reſpect to the lowly, to ſtrengthen them with grace and peace in their ſoules. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138. 3. 6. to perfect all that concerns them; <hi>verſe</hi> 8. The lowly ſtrangers ſee how the Lord welcomes them in prayer, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 56. <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. The penitent Prodigall that ſpeaks in ſuch a vilifying way of himſelfe to God his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 18, 19. ſees how royally and richly he is entertained by the Lord, like as by that father, <hi>verſe</hi> 22, 23. the coſtlieſt robes of grace, and delicateſt of mercy in Chriſt, are readily brought forth to ſuch; greateſt mercies are granted to ſuch, as pardon of ſinne, and the like. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13, 14. Yea, in ſuch a lively and convincing manner exhibited, as that they ſhall carry it home with them, the ſight and light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall ſtick by them; <hi>he went home juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> they ſhall in a holy triumphant wiſe carry home the garland of grace and peace, for which they wreſtled with God in praier: wheras in defect of Humility no praiers, nor tears of a proud <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhal avail. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 17. The Phariſees repair ſo diligently to pray to the temple is to little purpoſe, whilſt he doth not humble, but rather exalt himſelf therein. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 10, 14. God will not approve
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46945:164"/> of any ſuch mens perſons, or praiers; and ſuch a non-juſtified eſtate is a ſad aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſuch, <hi>ibid.</hi> as the gracious accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the perſons and prayers of humble ones in Chriſt Jeſus, is an high degree of honour and exalting to them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the ſervants of God are <note place="margin">2 Then are humble ones themſelves.</note> never more themſelves, as ſuch, then when humble in a way of ſeeking the face of God. When the converted Prodigall, and Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can cometh to rights, to himſelfe, then in that frame, hee betaketh himſelfe to this work. <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 17, 18, 19. Aſſuredly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent diſpoſitions work then ſtrongly, zeal and holy indignation againſt ſinne, and our ſelves for it, are then ſtirring, then is faith, and love doubtleſſe active, and putting forth themſelves in our ſoules.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe an humble frame of heart <note place="margin">3 It putteth moſt honour upon God and Chriſt.</note> in prayer putteth moſt honour upon God, and Chriſt, and mercy, and grace, as all in all. <hi>Aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> in that frame thinketh that it will put the largeſt heads, and ripeſt wits in the world to it, to conceive or expreſs the glory of God in Chriſt. <hi>Proverb.</hi> 30. 2, 3. compared with the 4<hi rend="sup">•h</hi>. And he wil mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the purity, perfection, and ſtability of his word. <hi>verſe</hi> 5. ſee <hi>verſe</hi> 1, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Aſaph</hi> when in that frame of heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 22. then who but the Lord of heaven and earth with him, and in his deſire! <hi>verſe</hi> 25. and if ſuch a poor ſoule get any mercy by praier, of all others hee will uſe it beſt, and give
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:46945:164"/> God the moſt glory of it, and for it, as might be ſhewed in divers inſtances.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Becauſe ſuch a kind of ſpirit in <note place="margin">1. It fitteth us moſt for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> prayer, it doth fit us moſt for the mercies of prayer. Hence it is compared to <hi>hunger,</hi> which as it is good ſawce to the body, and prepareth it well for its meat, ſo doth it fit the ſoul for its deſired food of grace and mercy. Hence is that oppoſition <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 53. betwixt the <hi>hungry and the rich,</hi> and yet rich is rather oppoſed to poor, becauſe indeed the pooreſt in ſpirit, the beggars in ſpirit are the moſt hungry. Look as the emptying of a veſſel fitteth it for being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with precious liquor; ſo humility by emptying the heart of all ſelf-ſtrength, ſelf-confidence, ſelf-ſufficiency, ſelf-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſelf-willedneſſe, and ſelf-conceit, it fitteth the ſoul in prayer for what it doth pray for. The heart of the humble is a prepared heart; as to pray to God, ſo likewiſe to receive and improve the mercies which it ſeeketh in prayer; ſuch an one is moſt flexible and ready both to uſe the beſt means to obtain the mercies deſired, and to walk worthy of them when obtained. So <hi>Job</hi> 7. 20. <hi>I have ſinned, what ſhall I do to thee, O thou Preſerver of men?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As touching the laſt thing propounded; <note place="margin">Helps to humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in prayer.</note> namely, What Helps and Means we ſhould uſe to further ſuch Humility required in prayer? I anſwer, </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:46945:165"/> 1. Set faith on work, as we ſhewed at <note place="margin">1. Faith in the Lord.</note> large the laſt Lecture. Faith in Gods Promiſe and Providence made <hi>David</hi> pray ſo humbly, as one not worthy to ſpeak more to God, or receive more from him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 18, 19, 27. That made the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal to throw down himſelf in ſuch ſort, and humbly to ſeek his fathers favour, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in him a fathers bowels, yea which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly might move towards him; he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive likewiſe that he hath all hee needeth, and that moveth and furthereth him therein, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 17, 18, 19. So it is here, the Publicans faith in that propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory merit and mercy cauſeth him ſo to ſpeak, as <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13. It was faith that ſet the woman a begging, in that humble and lowly, as well as earneſt manner, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 26, 27, 28, The faith of that woman was the inſtrumental meanes of her ſalvation, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 50. that was the means of that her ſilent, humble approach to the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 38. It is faith which taketh a true meaſure, both of God and of our ſelves, and thereby furthereth ſuch humility.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Get our hearts filled with love to the Lord. Love is a ſtooping grace, it will <note place="margin">2. Love to the Lord.</note> make a Chriſtian think meanly of all he ſaith or doth in behalf of Chriſt whom he loveth, that he never ſpeaketh nor doth enough for him. Love will make a man amplifie his worth and excellency, and glory, and even be ſpeaking well, even the beſt of him; and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:46945:165"/> that wil ſurely make him carry it ſubmiſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him, as very loath to diſpleaſe or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor him; and when at any time a Chriſtian wrongeth or offendeth the Lord, Oh how will love occaſion ſelf-loathing and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and diſtaſte, and trouble for it! The Lord Jeſus in giving that anſwer in that poor womans hearing, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 47. <hi>Her ſins which are many, are forgiven her, for ſhe loved much;</hi> ſheweth, that love al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſet her on work in ſuch humble and melting ſort to expreſſe the ſecret deſires of her ſoul unto him, touching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and clearing of her Juſtification, <hi>ver.</hi> 38.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Be we ſincere in heart in our prayers <note place="margin">3. Sincerity.</note> which we make. The ſincere hearted Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican will humble himſelf in ſeeking of Gods favour by prayer, when the leaven of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, will heave and puff up that Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee whilſt he is praying, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will make us in prayer ſpeak all freely and ingenuouſly on the part of God, and Chriſt, in way of good; and on our own part in way of our evil and emptineſs; it will make men of yeilding and flexible tempers, and cauſe perſons to be open and plain hearted with the Lord; and that they ſhall not refuſe or be unwilling to take any ſhame before God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Improve we the thoughts and ſerious <note place="margin">4. Thoughts of our need, and Gods greatnes</note> conſiderations of our needy conditions, as likewiſe of the greatneſſe of God. The
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:46945:166"/> Saints are ſtiled ſuch as are <hi>beggers in ſpirit. Matth.</hi> 5, 3. <hi>hungry,</hi> ver. 6. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 53 <hi>Deſtitute ones,</hi> Pſal. 102. 17. ſuch as whoſe beſt habilements are <hi>rags, Iſaiah</hi> 64. 6. <hi>Clay veſſels, the Lord our potter,</hi> ver. 8. <hi>Duſt, Gen.</hi> 18. 27. and ſuch like: the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof kept thoſe Saints of God, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and the reſt, humble in their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. When we look at this ragged condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ours, it will make us remember our ſelves, and keep us humble in our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Spread we much our own and Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors <note place="margin">5. Thoughts of our Anceſtors ſins.</note> ſins before the Lord when we are to pray. And thus did <hi>Daniel, chap.</hi> 9. thus did <hi>Ezra, chap.</hi> 9. The very ſerious mention and meditation of an offence of a child of God againſt his Father, will make a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate nature begin to work, and then will iſſue ſuch holy bluſhes in the face of an ingenious Chriſtian. If through the wily ſlights of Satan, and our deceitful hearts, we ſhould begin to gaze on our goodly fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and have ſome riſings of ſpirit in way of pride, yet at the ſight of this black foot of ours we ſhould then aſſuredly fall in our ſpirits.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Take we all holy advantages of ſuch <note place="margin">6. Taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of melting work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in our ſelves.</note> melting, weeping plights, in which we are ſometimes above others. <hi>Davids</hi> heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that humble plight upon occaſion of a good word of the Prophet, ſent to him from God, then <hi>David</hi> goeth in and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:46945:166"/> and then he carryeth it ſo humbly, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 18, 19, &amp;c. When <hi>Ezra</hi> upon the hearing of the evils among them, was put into that abaſed frame, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 3. then he falleth into that humble ſort to pray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. &amp;c. So whilſt <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiahs</hi> heart was even broken at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hearing of the ſad newes, he forthwith ſetteth himſelf in ſolemn wiſe to pray and <hi>weep before the Lord, Nehem.</hi> 1. 2, 3. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>verſe</hi> 4, 5. &amp;c. Albeit ſuch mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting deſires and inclinations ſhould haply be raiſed from other cauſes, or ſpiritual miſeries, yet being ſtirring already they may the better be ſpiritualized. There are times when we are ſo ſtrangely ſtupified, that ſcarce any thing will affect us, but when affected ſeriouſly with any thing, it is an advantrge (if improved wiſely) to turn ſuch waters, (the ſluces being now opened) into the right channel.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 In our ſecret approaches to the Lord, <note place="margin">7. Premeditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ſpend ſome time in ſerious premeditations, it will help to put us into a more ſerious frame of ſpirit, and that is the next neighbour to an humble and ſenſible plight. It will add plummets to fleety, lofty ſpirits; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if we ſeriouſly conſider of his Majeſty and Soveraignty before whom wee come; ſurely that will help to bring us on our knees: The ſight of the Kings Colours will doubtleſſe make all, but ſome preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous, careleſſe, ſtout ſpirits to lower their

                  <p>To the firſt we anſwer, That ſuch Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity conſiſteth in theſe ſix or ſeven <note place="margin">Sincerity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth</note> things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 In carrying on the whole buſineſs of <note place="margin">1. In praying as to God.</note> prayer as to God. Whether we confeſſe our ſins and miſeries, or crave redreſſe of them; whether we ask ſuch or ſuch bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings or favours for our ſelves or others: or whether we bleſſe the Lord for Grace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready vouchſafed us, for what elſe we do in Prayer, we are to carry it with ſuch awe and reverence as thoſe which are ſpeaking to God; and with ſuch intention, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and obſervance as thoſe that are now to deal with God; and to keep our true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, neither heartleſly diſtruſtful and diſmayed, and yet not heedleſly, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly, or malepertly bold with God; Afraid of him, yet not terrified by him; ſollaced in him therein, yet trembling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; ſatisfied in him, yet unſatisfied in continued deſires of mercy from him; reſting on him, yet reſtleſſe: and albeit reſtleſſe, as preſſing upon him for mercies we need, yet reſting on him quietly for the ſame. Having ſuch apprehenſions of God in the duty as befitteth him, and as are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to us, to the Duty, to the preſent work and workings therein. If we confeſs our ſins, we are ſenſibly apprehenſive of his Purity and Majeſty offended thereby;
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:46945:168"/> of his Goodneſſe and Patience abuſed therby; of his privity to them all, in their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; of his ſin-revenging Juſtice due thereto, of his ſole prerogative to pardon the ſame, of his readineſſe in Chriſt to do it. We are ſeriouſly apprehenſive of the vileneſſe of ſuch ſins, of our owne loathſom nature, whence they did ariſe, and our hearts riſe up in holy indignation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of them, and our ſelves for them: whilſt we mention the ſame, we bleed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them in our ſpirits, could even tread upon our ſelves, and take a holy revenge on our ſelves for the ſame: and all the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and breathings of our ſpirits in the mention of our ſins they are ſtil as to God: When we mention ſuch and ſuch wants of ſuch and ſuch mercies we crave, all is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to God. We have ſutable workings in our minds; we eye him as full of all grace and mercy, as treaſuring up all that fulneſs in the Lord Jeſus, as willing and free to communicate the ſame, as real in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the ſame; and the like might be ſaid in the reſt. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 5. 3. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>he will direct</hi> (or orderly ſettle, prepare, and adreſs) <hi>his prayer to the Lord.</hi> And Chriſt would have ſuch as pray, to <hi>pray to their Father which ſeeth in ſecret,</hi> Matth. 6. 6. <hi>Job would order his cauſe before the Lord,</hi> Job 23. 4.</p>

Chriſtians are to drive this holy trade with God, but yet as with his owne talents and commodities. <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 16. <hi>Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds</hi> (ſaith the good ſervant.)

                  <p n="3">3. In carrying on the whole work of <note place="margin">3 In doing it as for God.</note> prayer, as for God alone. The Suppliants of God bring their prayer, not as their offering, ſo much as Gods offering; <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 10. they do indeed lift up their prayer, as did the Prophet, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 37. 4. and their heart in prayer, yet ſo, as withal exalting God in both. <hi>Hee is extolled with their tongue, in their crying to God with their voyce. Pſal.</hi> 66. 17. The Saints confeſſe their ſins, that God may be cleared in his proceedings. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. 4. Expreſſe his mercies in prayer, not to ſet forth their owne praiſe and commendation as did the Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 10, 11, 12. But that the Lord rather may be glorified, and that the heart in the mention thereof may be awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to give him glory, and therefore they uſe in the mention thereof ſenſibly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix the mention of their own vileneſſe and wretchedneſſe. If they requeſt of God ſuch and ſuch mercies, yet it is that the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:46945:169"/> Lord may occaſionally be the more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in granting the ſame to them, whether the mercies bee of a ſpiritual or temporal nature. Albeit the mercies they crave, and immunitie from the miſeries which they complaine of to the Lord bee the matter of their prayers, yet not the ſole motive. Selfe is not the great wheel which ſetteth all the wheels of their hearts going, nor is ſelf the center in which thoſe many lines of their ſpirits and prayers doe end and meet, but rather the reſpect to the Lord, and his name, favour and preſence, theſe are all in all. They are a generation not of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeekers in their prayers, but <hi>of ſeekers of the face of the God of Jacob.

The maine of their deſires, is that the Lord Jeſus, the man of Gods right hand may be glorified, and that the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand of God may be with him in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and if he be exalted, that ſhall and will ingage them the rather to bee thankfull to God for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. 17, 18. <hi>The making of the refuſed stone, the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of the corner, is that wonder of grace in which they thankfully rejoyce.

Hee would have his former joy againe, not becauſe he made any idol of his comforts, and was all for comfort in his ſpirit, for he is as earneſt for a cleare and ſound heart, <hi>verſe</hi> 10.

Hee would have his mouth opened, <hi>verſe</hi> 15.

                  <p>Now to anſwer more briefly to the ſecond thing propounded: The Reaſons <note place="margin">Reaſons of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in praier</note> why God requireth Sincerity in our praier, may be ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe Purity and ſimplicity is moſt <note place="margin">1. Sincerity is moſt ſutable to Gods nature to whom wee pray.</note> ſutable to his nature with whom wee have to do in prayer: as a ſimple pure Spirit, <hi>he will be worſhipped in ſpirit and in truth, John</hi> 4. 23, 24. He ſeeketh moſt that part of his Image of Truth and Purity, in any perſon or performance. <hi>Such doth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeek to worſhip hiw,</hi> ibid. Truth in the inward parts is that which he eyeth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. 6. The more of that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the more approved, the more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him: <hi>The words of the pure are</hi> (to God alſo) <hi>pleaſant words, Prov.</hi> 15. 26. His Image in his children is lovely. The child that is likeſt his Father, is moſt made of. The purity and ſincerity of the people of God is reckoned their perfection, albeit they have many imperfections attending their perſons and performances. Thence are the godly called <hi>the perfect,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. Beſides, Purity and Sincerity is moſt ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Chriſt our High Prieſt, who was <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and undefiled, Hebr.</hi> 7. 26. And God would have his Prieſts, his Saints, <hi>an holy Prieſthood,</hi> and ſo <hi>conformable to him,</hi> 1 Pet. 2 3. Beſides, there is Truth, Reality, Seriouſneſſe, and Solidity in all we eye and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:46945:172"/> improve in prayer; and therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if God will have us carryed with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable frame of ſpirit therein; the Prieſt of our Profeſſion is what he is really, Truth it ſelf, <hi>John</hi> 14. 6. The meritorious Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was real and true; it was the Sacrifice of <hi>himſelf, Hebr.</hi> 9. 26. The Covenant of Chriſts blood, a real, ratified, forcible Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8. 6. and <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The way made for us a <hi>true and living way,</hi> and therefore we may well draw neer to God with true hearts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22 verſes compared.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Becauſe Sincerity ever uſeth to put <note place="margin">2. Sincerity ſtrengthneth our praiers.</note> to all its ſtrength in prayer; and that is it which the Lord liketh beſt. <hi>Hypocriſie divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth;</hi> James 1. 6, 8. and that doudling and dividing maketh weak work. It is not pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheard ſtrength, which is but brittle, and will not abide any knocks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 23. Burning lips in zealous expreſſions, joyned with a wretched falſe heart, are but like a pot ſheard covered with ſilver droſſe; but Sincerity is ſingle and unanimous in all its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and ſo its united force muſt needs be more available.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Becauſe Sincerity putteth a holy grace <note place="margin">3. Sincerity moſt graceth our prayers.</note> upon, and force into our words in Prayer. Hence that ſtrength ordeined in the mouths of babes, intire and ſincere ones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Grace of the lips</hi> is joyned with <hi>pureneſſe of heart,</hi> Prov. 22. 11. And as earthly Kings befriend that in their Petitioners, ſo doth the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:46945:173"/> Lord in his. Hence is it that <hi>David</hi> pleads his unfained ſpeaking to God in prayer as an Argument with God to hear him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 1.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Becauſe prayers of ſincere ones are <note place="margin">4. Sincerity getteth moſt in prayer.</note> ever of moſt publick uſe and good, and that is a thing the Lord greatly liketh. A pure handed and hearted <hi>Job</hi> praying to the Lord, ſhall deliver the Iland where hee is thereby, <hi>Job</hi> 22. 27, 30. by the <hi>bleſſing of the upright the City where they are is exalted, Prov.</hi> 11. 11.</p>
                  <p>Touching the third thing propounded: the Marks and Characters of Sincerity in <note place="margin">Marks of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in praier</note> prayer are ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 When the main and choice matte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials <note place="margin">1. When the materials in praier are the beſt things</note> of our prayers are right and holy things. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 17. 1, 2. When our hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring deſires expreſſed in prayer, are after Righteouſneſſe, they are ſurely ſuch as are accounted of God ſincere, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 6. when in prayer alſo we firſt and chiefly <hi>ſeek the kingdom of God,</hi> Matth 6. 33. the <hi>light of Gods countenance,</hi> Pſal. 4. 6. not as the moſt do, ſome worldly good, <hi>ibid.</hi> When wee mind not baſer, common mettal, braſs or tin, &amp;c. but Gold and Silver, precious Materials, requeſts of weight and worth with God; it argueth we have ſome ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual meaſure of Sincerity and Purity within, when we trade with God, not about trifles but pearles of great price; it argueth we are not Pedlars, Mountebank hypocrites, but
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:46945:173"/> ſolid and ſubſtantial Merchants and Citizens of Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 When our whole man doth act in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; <note place="margin">2. When the whole man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth in praier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> underſtanding, and judgment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and will, and affections, they doe their parts in it, and are joynt Petitioners and Suppliants, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 109. 4. <hi>But I prayer,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> he was all prayer, or all of <hi>David,</hi> or in <hi>David,</hi> was herein imployed. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 58. <hi>With my whole heart</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have I intreated thy favour;</hi> the ſoul and ſpirit, all the inwards, and the ſublimeſt parts of the Church are employed therein, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 26. 9. If this little world in man, this little Commonwealth in a Chriſtian become a joint Solicitour unto our heavenly Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, ſurely this King of Saints will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the requeſts ſerious, and the Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citour intire therein; as earthly Kings do the joint Petitions of whole Bodies, and Counties and Countries. When every ſtring in the Inſtrument ſounds its part and keeps due proportion, both the Inſtrument is right tuned, and the Muſick and Leſſon played is fulleſt of true harmony. So it is here, the Saints when intirely and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſed in the prayers they make, ſurely they are ſincerely employed therein. When all within the ſoul, as bound by Oath, and Vow and Covenant unto the Lord; to deal truly in matters touching him and us, do agree in what they preſent and utter before him, ſurely then it will paſſe for a true
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:46945:174"/> verdict, as in other caſes it doth with men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 When in praying ſtil we indeavour to <note place="margin">3 When we ſtil ſtrive to pray to purpoſe.</note> do it to purpoſe, or elſe we are to our ſelves as if we had not prayed. Righteous ones will pray effectually, <hi>James</hi> 5. 15, 16. if they pray, they lift up a prayer unto the Lord, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 4. When a Factour or ſervant will not leave trading or working until he make ſomething of it, you will ſay then he is honeſt, and juſt in his calling or dealing; like <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant, he prefers his Maſters occaſions which he was to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, before his very food, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 33. and <hi>verſe</hi> 49. as he was ſerious in ſpeaking his errand, ſo in preſſing for his anſwer; and when he hath done, haſtes to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne thereof to his Maſter, <hi>ver.</hi> 56. ſo it is here in ſerving God with our ſpirits in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 9. They are true and truſty Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to their Commander and Country, which will not out of the field without ſome Trophies of Victory; like thoſe which when thereto injoyned and adjured (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 24, 26.) though the honey would even drop into their mouths, as they were in the purſuit of the enemy, yet they mind the completeing of the Victory, albeit with ſome denyals of themſelves in their preſent refreſhments. So it is here, when we are ſincerely ſet to ſeek and wreſtle for mercy, we will not away without a bleſſing in and by it. Or as a Pleader is honeſt in ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:46945:174"/>
                     <pb facs="tcp:46945:175"/>
                     <pb n="321" facs="tcp:46945:175"/> a Clients caſe, when he will not ceaſe pleading until he have brought the ſame to ſome comfortable iſſue; ſo is it with the ſpirit of a Chriſtian, which is mainely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by us in this holy pleading work; the more ſerious, reſolute and unmoveable it is therein or therefrom, without ſome good ſucceſs, the more ſincere.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 When we ſtraine not much to ſpeak <note place="margin">4. When wee ſtrive to ſpeak as it is with us</note> more then is, or otherwiſe then it is, either in the general bent of our ſouls, or then is in the preſent deſires of our ſpirits, or then is in the ſenſe or feelings, or fears, or griefs, or workings of our hearts; but ſpeak as things are to us and with us. It is not ſo much the ſtrength of braines and judgement, or memory, that prompteth the mouth to ſpeak, to fil up time with aiery expreſſions, as the ſtrength of heart work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, of holy deſires and griefs, &amp;c. which put the people of God upon uttering what they do in prayer; they had rather ceaſe, after ſome ſerious ſtrivings to the contrary, againſt diſtempered, ſenſeleſſe ſpending of time in meer words without ſpiritual life, then go on in ſuch ſort, albeit they may ſeem to themſelves or others but in an ill paſſe at preſent by reaſon thereof. <hi>I opened my mouth and panted</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 131) <hi>for I longed for thy Commandments.</hi> Strength of holy deſires after Grace, to underſtand, believe, and practice the Word of God more, made him be ſo large and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:46945:176"/> zealous in his prayers, out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, not of his head, but of his heart, his mouth thus ſpeaketh. Hence the Saints prayers are called their <hi>deſires, Pſal.</hi> 145. 18 and 10. 17.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 When we are moſt frequent and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <note place="margin">5. When moſt frequent and fervent in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret praier.</note> in ſecret prayers of all other prayers. As it is ſaid of grief, ſo is it true of prayer, He prayeth moſt truly and ſincerely, that prayeth moſt ſecretly. Hence our Saviour doth oppoſe ſecret prayer to hypocritical praying, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6 5, 6. Slye falſe dealers will be careful and very exact in what they ſpeak when witneſſes are by; but honeſt men will be as exact in what they ſpeak to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all alone. So is it here; many, it may be, which carry it with much Zeal and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection before others, yet in their Cloſets if they do pray at all, it is ſo flatly, ſo drouzily, ſo curtly, ſo careleſſely, that it is as good as no prayer at all. Let ſuch look to their ſpirits whether all be right within. Whatſoever falſe hearted ſpouſes may ſeem to ſpeak ſo and ſo lovingly &amp; loyally to their Spouſes before others, that ſuch as are by would take them to bee very chaſte and faithful, and kind; yet if in ſecret, they carry it otherwiſe, their honeſty may well be ſuſpected. So is it here, if Chriſtians ſhould carry it in expreſſions in prayer with others as if very loyal to the Lord Jeſus, but in ſecret it is quite otherwiſe, their hearts are not ſo intire and honeſt as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:46945:176"/> their profeſſion. Verily, ſincerity is plain and open hearted, and ſurely never more then when alone with God its friend. Sincerity in prayer, is ſimplicity and ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in prayer; and therefore will be the ſame every where. If praying with others, ſtriving ſtill to ſpeak with ſuch life and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and holineſſe as is meet: and if alone praying, it will put us upon the like ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of attentiveneſs, and intentiveneſs in, and on the duty in hand.</p>

Self will be ſometimes prayer full, and ſo will hypocriſe, becauſe its good and ſutable to both; ſatisfying the deſires of both, and furthering the ends and aimes of both may come in thereby: But ſincerity is that which is and will be praiſeful and thankful. An honeſt and poor man will ſcarce ever forget a ſpeciall kindneſſe ſhewed to him by another at his requeſt in a time of his neceſſity; when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he meeteth his friend, he will be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a long time after; and when he is with others, he will be thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the ſame to the great commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that his freind.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:46945:177"/> grace and ſincerity thereof is more tried when he getteth prayer bleſſings, then when he wanteth the ſame. Self being empty pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but ſelf when full looketh but to his own ſatiety: but ſelf-denyal the daughter and hand-maid of Sincerity, will not be ſo circled within the compaſſe of ſelfe in his prayers. Look as it is in a Proſpective glaſs, if you turne the wrong end formoſt, great things will ſeem very ſmall, and things that are neareſt will appear, as a far off, and ſmall things will hardly be diſcerned. So is it here; when ſelf and hypocriſie are to look upon mercies of prayer; great ones are but little and ſmall mercies, none at all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſincerity taketh the trueſt ſurvey of them all in their dimenſions, &amp; colours, and therefore no wonder if it be thankful; ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity will bear ſuch true and full witneſſe to our extreme miſery in our ſelves, that the light and white of mercy, compared with this darkneſs and black, will prove very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable and praiſe-worthy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sincerity will truly and faithfully compare our worthineſs and utter unworthineſs at our beſt, with Chriſts glorious merit and worthineſſe, that the eye of the ſoul that looks on, cannot but diſcerne praiſe worthy glory therein. Greatneſs and abſolute Soveraignty, and independency in the Lord, and unutterable nearneſs and dependency in us ſhall truly be preſented and compared in a ſincere hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Suppliant, and can he be other then
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:46945:178"/> very thankful? Selfe, (which prompteth a falſe hearted Chriſtian to ſpeake for bleſſings) will be Judge too of the ſame. And there is little likelihood of right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to proceed from ſo bloody and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful an Umpire; and if not rightly judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, what thanks to be expected? But ſincerity judgeth of divine bleſſings by the Rules of the Spirit and Word of God. The ſpring of Sincerity in Prayer riſeth from God; and therefore it will aſſuredly return to God in praiſes which are ſutable. <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 13, 15, 19. The ſincere Samaritan Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant is as loud in his praiſes of God, as ever he was in his prayers, but ſo were not the other.</p>

When Sincerity is interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this whole piece of our lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, it will ſhew it ſelf in this part of it. Sincerity and right things ſhould be our conſtant and daily ſtudy. <hi>The thoughts of the Righteous are right,</hi> Prov. 12. 5. and therefore no wonder that the <hi>words of the pure are pleaſant words,</hi> Prov. 11. 26. When
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:46945:178"/> men love pureneſſe of heart in all their courſes, there will be a grace and ſavour thereof in all their diſcourſes with God or men, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 11. when perſons double in ſome things with God and their owne ſoules, they will do ſo in other things like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. <hi>James</hi> 1. 8. <hi>A double minded man is unſtable in all his wayes: Hypocriſie is leaven. Luke</hi> 12. 1. if you lay it, and hide it, and ſuffer it to lye in one part of the lump of your converſation, it will ſpread, and ſowre all the reſt ſoon, <hi>James</hi> 4. 2, 3. compared, preſcribing the remedy of that guileful ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpend the bleſſings of God <hi>upon their luſts. verſe</hi> 23. He inſtanceth the double minds that ſuch have, and they muſt purge themſelves of their double mind in all other things if ever they would approach and draw nigh to God in prayer rightly, and not <hi>ask amiſſe;</hi> and for this purpoſe get we our hearts and hands rid of what ever ſinfull defilements which do foment that doubling with God, and hindreth this integrity in prayer. If men in any kind retain the ſame, they will <hi>ask amiſſe,</hi> ask things with a falſe adulterous heart; <hi>ibid. verſes</hi> 23, 4. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. We ſhall never make ſtreight ſteps in this part of our chriſtian race, <hi>if that which is lame be not healed. Heb.</hi> 12. 13. If the feet of our affections be diſeaſed, we can never wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle with God ſo ſtably, but ſhall halt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as well as in other of the waies of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When at any time we eſpy any flaws
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:46945:179"/> or doublings with God in prayer, (as the <note place="margin">2 Be truely abaſed for any guile therein.</note> beſt ſometimes may eſpy ſome guileful ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and overlineſſe therein) be we greatly abaſed for the ſame, as <hi>James</hi> wiſheth ſuch as ask amiſſe, and ſuch falſe ſpirits therein, <hi>James</hi> 4. 2, 3, 4. or ſuch as would bee rid of ſuch doubling guileful diſtempers, <hi>verſe</hi> 8. to be afflicted and mourne: namely, for that doubling with God and their owne ſoules, when Chriſtians pay deare for ſuch ſlyneſſe and ſlightneſſe, they will ſurely take heed thereof; the more bitter it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, and grievous to their palate, the more will they leave it and loath it. It is to be feared that many Chriſtians which ſee ſuch ſlyneſs and guilineſs in prayer, they are content ſometimes that they have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, albeit the ſame were a ſhell and ſhadow of the duty, and the pith and ſubſtance thereof were wanting; or if they bee trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled lightly &amp; ſlightly with it, all is not wel with them, that they deal not ſo faithfully with God and their owne ſouls, yet they are not throughly ſtirred up with ſerious griefe and holy indignation by reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and therefore goe on oft times in ſuch a way. If guile of ſpirit were ſo exactly and throughly examined and ſentenced, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revenge taken upon it, ſuch a cheater would not ſo much haunt the hearts of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in this and other of the ordinances of God as it doth. And to this let me add, that we carefully and reſolutely reſiſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:46945:179"/> when at any time, then, or afterwards, he doth tempt us to this guilineſs and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs in our talking with God in prayer: give not the leaſt way to it, but when at firſt you perceive the tempter buſie that way, to put us upon ſiniſter ends in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, or any ſly dealing with God and our ſoules in prayer, away with it, ſtrongly and ſeaſonably bend we all our ſtrength againſt it, diſcover to God by humble and ſolemn confeſſion that treacherous motion, cry out upon it, purſue it, and never leave till we have ſent it packing with ſhame and loathing of heart. Hence is it that <hi>James</hi> wiſheth ſuch as were ſo guily in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they made, <hi>James</hi> 4. 2, 3, 4. to make uſe of that remedy, <hi>Reſiſt the divell,</hi> namely, <hi>in his temptation thereunto, and he will flye from you, verſe</hi> 7. and eſpying ſuch like wilineſſe of ſpirit in our prayers, let us bee willing to be croſſed in any ſuch requeſts as we make with ſuch a ſpirit, for verily God wil not grant ſuch deſires to us if he love us, <hi>Jam.</hi>

Many of the Saints ſee cauſe to bleſſe God afterwards, that the Lord did not grant ſuch or ſuch requeſts of theirs, perceiving that indeed their heads were not right therein; and tis well for them that God will croſſe them in any ſinfull deſires of theirs, yea, it would be better for us that God ſhould fall upon us with ſome good downeright blowes, whilſt we carry it thus

They are ever proud ſpirits that have ſuch ſelfe-aims and ſlie reſpects to their own names or ſuch good bleſſings as the main in their praiers, which may make them ſeeme ſome body amongſt men, what ever approbation therein they get with God. <hi>James</hi> telleth thoſe he mentioned, that they were of <hi>adulterous ſpirits, James</hi> 4. 4. that they asked and had not, as asking amiſſe, out of baſe reſpects: and <hi>verſe</hi> 2, 3. &amp; <hi>verſe</hi> 6. he telleth them more plainely that they would be above others in gifts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and eſtate, &amp;c. <hi>Envy</hi> ſetteth them on work, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. they are proud, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God reſiſteth them in that way of asking; but humble ones get the grace of him
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:46945:180"/> which their hearts ſeek.

Wee ſhall then draw near to God with the trueſt hearts, when with moſt aſſurance. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. There is ſecret Atheiſme of heart or infidelity, and much unbeliefe, in that any at any time dare to double with God in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to him, making God like to man, which might be mocked and deluded with goodly words and pretences, and not to bee a ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of their heart and reines; elſe men durſt not make ſo bold with him, to baffle with him to his face. <hi>David,</hi> one that had made too bold to affirme that of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, of his hatred of Gods enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139, 22, 23. qualifieth it with a plaine hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted motion to him, whom he knew was privy to his ſpirit, to ſearch it, and <hi>ſee whether there were any way of wickedneſſe in him, and to ſteer his courſe for him in the right way.</hi> Where faith is, love will attend and ſhew it ſelfe; love uſeth ſtill to be candid and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, and intire in all its ſpeeches to him
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:46945:181"/> whom the ſoule loveth, the more that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth, the more ſincere. When the Apoſtle prayeth that the <hi>Philppians</hi> may be ſincere (in all their words, and walks, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting God, themſelves, or others,) <hi>hee prayeth that their love may abound;</hi> then will they approve the moſt excellent things.

                  <p>Motives to ſincerity in prayer, may bee <note place="margin">Motives to ſincerity. It will argue Gods effectual ſpeaking to us, and ours to him.</note> ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p>In that it will be an argument of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and ſound fruit of Gods ſpeaking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and of our effectual ſpeaking to him. The former is evident; when our prayer lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is ſincere, ſurely God hath turned unto us ſome pure lip, ſome ſoul-ſaving miniſtry. <hi>Zeph</hi> 3. 9, 10. Such of the Cities of <hi>Egypt</hi> as ſhould bee converted ſavingly, the Prophet ſaith, they ſhould (as a fruit thereof) <hi>ſpeak the language of Canaan. Iſai.</hi> 19. 18.

And the latter is as evident; truth in our ſeeking of God, and mercy in Gods anſwers, will ſurely meet together as in other caſes they doe
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:46945:181"/> 
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 10. The Lord himſelfe maketh it an argument of his reſpect to his peoples deſires, in that they are <hi>children that will not lye, Iſai.</hi> 63. 8. and giveth it as a pledg when they may expect infallibly that he will anſwer their prayers, namely, when they are cordial and intire in ſeeking of him, when they ſeek him with all their heart. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 11, 12, 13. And the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt maketh his cordial and intire ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, to which his very conſcience was privy, and the Lord much rather, as an argument with God, to pray for reſpect to his deſires. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 10, 94. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and integrity in our ſpeeches is ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to men, to all ſorts of men. <hi>Proverb.</hi> 16. 13, and 24. 26. and the God of truth is not leſſe, but more delighted in the words of truth. Hence it is that upright hearted Supplicants, they are (and well they may be) freeſt and boldeſt of all others with the Lord. Such as come with true hearts, come with much confidence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 21. they can and dare walk at liberty when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to their integrity, that they ſeek the ſtatutes of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 45.

True it is, that God is up before us, he is ſtirring early for his peoples help, as ſoon as the face of the morning, or ſeaſon of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy to them appeareth, he helpeth them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 46. 5. but yet wee may not be up in our ſpirits; we had need rowze up our hearts, as being too oft drowſie at ſuch times, and not watching for the firſt day-break of a ſeaſon of mercy. So that look as <hi>David</hi> did when to praiſe God, that are we to do when to pray to him, <hi>Awake early, Pſal,</hi> 57. 7, 8. There is much ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſluggiſhneſſe cleaveth to the ſpirits of the beſt in ſpiritual ſervices: as ſometimes the eyes of their bodies were covered with ſleep when they ſhould have prayed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 4. ſo is it too oft with our ſpirits when they are not in wakeful plight. That God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Matron when to utter a Song of Praiſe to God, ſee how ſhe doubleth, and redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the word <hi>Awake; Awake, awake Deborah, Awake, awake, utter a Song.</hi> Judg. 5. 12. It is not a little calling that will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake our ſlumbring, heavy eyed ſpirits. Sometimes they call up a ſleeping <hi>Jonah</hi> to <hi>ariſe and call upon his God,</hi> Jonah 1. 6. <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> muſt be rowſed out of his ſleepineſſe to obſerve the <hi>Viſion, by the Angel, Zach.</hi> 4. 1. When the Lord Jeſus would hear his Doves voice in prayer, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. ſee how oft he calleth to her to <hi>ariſe and come away, verſe</hi> 10, 13. Sometimes the Spirit of God
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:46945:185"/> in their conſciences and ſpirits themſelves calleth them up to attend this holy imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if any morning light of approaching grace peepeth forth, or ſeaſon of doing the Lord ſervice in prayer is obſerved, as in <hi>Deborah,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and others of the Saints. If ever our ſpirits had need be up and ready, they had need be ſo when we are to pray. A ſleepy ſpirit will ſcarce ſpeak ſenſe (as I may ſay) to God in prayer. It is burthenſome to a friend to ſtand liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to a ſleepy broken diſcourſe, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of half words and ſentences indiſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed and uttered in his ears, albeit it be by his friend. So is it in a like ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, diſorderly drowſie praying and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lord: as men in a ſleepy fit, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſe ſomething they got in their hand, then get more unto the ſame by craving it in ſuch a drowſie ſort: So is it here, we are loſers and not gainers by prayers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto our ſpirits are not wakened to be fit to ſpeak to the Lord as becometh him &amp; us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In heeding to make uſe of all holy and <note place="margin">2 In taking all prayer advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</note> ſpecial advantages unto prayer that Divine Providence offereth. When Chriſtians wait for ſuch <hi>items</hi> of Providence, ſuch ſpeaking invitations to Prayer, then they watch unto prayer indeed. As at other poſts of the doors of Chriſt, ſo at this are the Saints to watch and wait, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 33. 34. Albeit the Lord, in reſpect of his own diſpoſition to mercy, be alwayes ready to
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:46945:186"/> hear and help his people, yet he is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be ſpoken withal for that end; neither are we ſo fit to ſpeak to him. At ſometimes againe it is in our hearts to pray to the Lord, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>he found in his heart to pray that prayer to God,</hi> 2 Sam. 7. 27. At other times that advantage was to ſeek. It requireth much holy skill and care, to eſpie and diſcern advantages to prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. A wandring, watchleſſe, ſpiritleſſe, ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh eye obſerveth them not, eſpieth them not, diſcerneth not the ſame.</p>

Like Pleaders, Saints ought to be good Students, that they may bee the fitter to plead: we are to ſtudy our hearts and lives, and the caſes of both, before wee plead them. Or look as Trades men do look over and ſet their marks upon their parcels ere they do retail them: ſo in this caſe ought the Saints to look over the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of their hearts, and lives, before they do trade with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in prayer about the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 In obſerving wiſely the frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <note place="margin">In minding the plight of our ſpirits when to pray.</note> in which we are, when wee are to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe our ſelves to prayer; how fit we are, or unfit for prayer; how far lively, or liſtleſſe or dead hearted; how far ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or otherwiſe ſenſeleſſe; how far ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

And the like obſervation did the Church make of her heart when to ſeek the Lord; ſtrong and lively deſires of God and his favour were ſtirring in her, and ſhe is reſolved to improve them that way to the utmoſt. How many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which pretend to be ſeekers of God, are utterly careleſſe in making theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and being thus heart awaked for this duty? which I leave to their own conſciences ſeriouſly to conſider.

So far as any ſluggiſhneſſe ſtealeth upon us we are ready to ſhake it off, and to rowſe and raiſe up our ſpirits in this holy work.

The Lord is an All ſeeing God.</note> and All-ſeeing God, and well may we then mind what wee ſpeak and think in prayer before him. If that we our ſelves do not obſerve our hearts, how, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or to what they are carried out in prayer, yet he doth, and he will diſcover us to our ſhame, how our ſpirits were excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in our prayers, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 78. 34, 35 36, 37. and <hi>James</hi> 4, 2 3.</p>

Sometimes the

Hee light of ſuch a heart by hap, (as we ſay) or upon ſerious and long ſeeking of ſuch a heart, for the Hebrew word wil bear both. It is one of the holy chances (if I may ſo call it) that any of us overtake a heart fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with holy praying diſpoſitions. It is ſo ſlippery this way, that if we look not ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to it, when we think we have got hold and made ſtay of our wandring ſpirits (ſuch they are as far as carnal) yet they will then ſteal away from us, and leave us; and when they are but a little while gone aſide, it is very difficult to recover ſight or hold of them again for ſuch holy imployment: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we ſhould ſeem to lay a lock and chain upon them, by our holy reſolutions and vowes; yet verily our hearts have their pick-locks, and the divel for a ſhift will lend them a file: there is no keeping of them from their natural wandrings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a very ſtrict hand and vigilant eye kept over them. That ſlippery flitting diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart, which ruleth in hypocrites, doth at leaſt dwell in the dear children of God, ſo that it is partly in them, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly fulfilled in hypocrites: their goodneſſe, good thoughts and workings in the wayes and Ordinances of God, are
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:46945:191"/> ſometimes too like unto morning clouds, which mount heaven-ward in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but forthwith vaniſh out of ſight, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 4.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 In that God and Chriſt watch then <note place="margin">6. The Lord then doth watch to help and hear us, and Angels to obſerve and help us.</note> to give us a lift in prayer, that our ſpirits may be more and more elevated, and to be then whiſpiring items of Grace to us, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue us from oppoſitions of the wily enemies of our ſouls and the like: he waiteth to be gracious to us then, in hearing and helping us at the voice of our cryes, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 30. 18, 19. He obſerveth carefully the reſiſtances made by Satan againſt his <hi>Joſhuahs, Zach.</hi> 3. 1, 2.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving handled the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer parts reſpecting the duty it ſelfe of prayer, and the modification and qualifications thereof, we now come to the laſt part of this diſcourſe about prayer, namely, to
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:46945:200"/> ſpeak to ſome caſes of Conſcience, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the inceſſant practiſe of this duty of prayer.</p>
                  <p>The firſt caſe reſpecteth the perſons, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>1</label> which are to obey this indefinite injunction; whether onely regenerate perſons are bound thus to pray? or that it be not alſo a duty which lyeth even upon unregenerate perſons to indeavour obedience to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juction, <hi>Pray without ceaſing:</hi> or if ſuch perſons ſhould indeavour the practiſe of this duty, how far forth they may come up to it, and be carryed out in the obedience thereof; and likewiſe what ſucceſſe may come thereof, whether their praiers may not be heard and anſwered of God, or how far forth (at leaſt) God may heare, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, even their prayers?</p>
                  <p>The caſe it ſelfe doubtleſſe may lye ſad upon ſome ſpirits, which either ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, or concluding, out of ſome diſmall horrours of heart, their eſtate to be but of the eſtate of meere naturall perſons, they queſtion whether the injunction doe lay a bond upon them to obey it, albeit, it may be, they would deſire to come up to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of it; eſpecially, conſidering that the Scripture requireth that ſuch as pray, ſhould pray in faith, and believe that <hi>they ſhall receive what they ask. Mark</hi> 11. 24. <hi>Whatſoever yee ask, believe that yee receive them, and yee ſhall have them.</hi> And this they cannot doe, finding no aſſurance of
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:46945:201"/> any intereſt in God, nor being able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves that Chriſt died for them in particular, and through this miſtaken fancy, that there can be no true faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a firme perſwaſion and aſſurance that Chriſt is theirs, (which is rather a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect then direct act of faith, and which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther followeth after ſome time and ſtrength of faith, acting upon Chriſt in a holy caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoule upon Chriſt alone for mercy, and leaving upon him all the help and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which they deſire) thus are they kept off, and ſcarce dare to pray, conceiting that they are not qualified and fitted yet for it: they cannot lift up pure hands without doubting. Beſides, God ſaith, that <hi>the prayer of a wicked man is an abomination to the Lord. Proverb.</hi> 15. 8. And they think that they are ſuch wicked ones in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and can or will God take a prayer in good part from ſuch wicked ones as they are? Surely no. Neither will Satan the enemy of prayer neglect the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to preſent to them the ſtricteſt of the qualifications required of ſuch as ſeek God by praier, and that unleſſe they could come up to that ſtrictneſſe of the rule, (which is laid ſtrait that the people of God may by little and little come as near to it as they can) and that forthwith, at firſt ſetting about the work, &amp;c. it is not for ſuch as they are to attempt the ſame; and better were it for them to ſit ſtill and be ſilent;
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:46945:201"/> and ſo would (if poſſible) take them off from uſing meanes to be better, and make them reſolve never to ſeek after a better eſtate then what they are in already; the devill knowing right well, that God who orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſuch or ſuch an end of good to his people, ordereth ſuch and ſuch good means to be uſed, for attaining of that end.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch ſuſpicions of tender hearts, being moſt what groundleſſe ſurmiſes, need not, muſt not diſcourage any from prayer, in whom the Lord hath wrought a pliable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart to the mind of God therein, and a deſire to obey his injunction thereof, this is to them as an inward call and invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God to call upon him. The more tremblingly they ſet about this duty with ſenſe both of their owne unworthineſſe and unfitneſſe to performe it, the fitter they are for it. And ſuppoſe the worſt, that their ſurmiſes are grounded, yet verily, the more ſad they ſee or ſuſpect their eſtate to be, the more need have they to ſeek God by prayer. When wicked <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did diſcover the naughtineſſe and falſeneſſe of his heart, <hi>Simon Peter</hi> doth not now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him to pray, but he injoyneth him to <hi>pray God, if perhaps the thought of his heart may bee forgiven him.</hi> If there be any poſſibility of a mans ſalvation, if there bee but a perhaps left of pardon, and that of one at preſent in <hi>the gall of bitterneſſe,</hi> and <hi>bond of iniquity;</hi> as ſuch a one is bound to
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:46945:202"/> repent, ſo alſo to pray. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 21, 22, 23. Some will be ready to put off theſe injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of prayer, as ſuch as concern Puritans; but as for ſuch as they are, what boot is it for them to pray? It was reckoned among the prophane ſpeeches of them of old, <hi>Job</hi> 21. 14, 15. <hi>What profit ſhould we have if we pray to him?</hi> Yea, but ſome now adayes hold it as their judgement, that it is to no purpoſe for unregenerate perſons to pray; becauſe indeed they are got bound to pray. They were as good joyne in the reſt of the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches there condemned and branded for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, and ſtand up againſt the holy Ghoſt, charging the prophane ſpeeches of thoſe unregenerate ones: and maintaine them in it, that they ought not to deſire the knowledg of Gods ways, they ought not to ſerve him, they ought not to pray to him and therfore may ſay to God, <hi>depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledg of thy ways: and what is the Almighty, that we ſhould ſerve him? and what profit is it if we pray to him?</hi> An unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate heart who of it ſelfe is averſe from any way of God, and would not be ſubject to the law of God, would gladly have ſuch a Tenent to hold up againſt God and his ſervants, to excuſe them from ſeeking unto God by prayer, as not bound to do it.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore give anſwer to the ſeveral branches of the caſe propounded, and ſhew, 1. That an unregenerate perſon <note place="margin">Unregenerate Perſons are bound to pray. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ecauſe,</note> is bound to pray. 2. That ſuch a one may
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:46945:202"/> be ſtrangely carryed out in prayer, 3. That God may heare and anſwer his prayer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then, that an unregenerate man is bound to pray, is evident from this indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite injunction, <hi>Pray without ceaſing;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regenerate or unregenerate. The wicked man, who <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55. 7. is charged to <hi>forſake his evil wayes and thoughts,</hi> is firſt charged, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>to ſeek the Lord whilſt he may be found, to call upon him whilſt he is near. Pſal.</hi> 65. 2. <hi>All fleſh ſhall come to thee,</hi> whether they are good or bad perſons.</p>
                  <p>For Firſt it is a duty which lyeth upon <note place="margin">1 Prayer is natural wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip required of all ſorts in the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> all men, as created and made by God. It is a naturall worſhip. It is that which the law of nature, as well as that of the word of God doth put men upon. Hence even the moſt Pagan people all doe call upon ſome God. <hi>Jonah</hi> 1. 5. <hi>The mariners cryed every man to his God. Iſai.</hi> 45. 20. <hi>They pray to a God that cannot ſave.</hi> Among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>things contained in the Law, they do this alſo by nature. Rom</hi> 2 14. If they omit cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon God, their naturall conſcience will accuſe them for it; or if they do call upon God, it will ſo far excuſe them and incourage them in it, <hi>v.</hi> 15. other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men which live under the light of the word, if they neglect it, they ſin both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light of nature, and the light of the word of God. Heathens and other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urallmen will be damned for this ſin of not calling upon God. Hence are they twice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precated
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:46945:203"/> againſt, as under that conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of not ho nouring of God, ſo of not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon him; as highly ſinning in the one as well as in the other. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79. 6. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 25. <hi>Powre out thy wrath upon the Heathen that know thee not, and the Families that call not on thy Name.</hi> Unregenerate perſons, as well as others, are bound by the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, to <hi>have no other Gods but God,</hi> and therefore bound to worſhip the Lord onely, and no other God but him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; and therefore to love him and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, to fear him and no other God, to truſt in him and no other God, to pray to him and no other God beſide him, &amp;c. as they are bound to make no graven ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of God, to worſhip the true God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his owne inſtituted worſhip, and not any other of mens inventing; and as they are likewiſe bound not to take Gods name in vain, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Prayer is a meanes ordered by the Lord, even for the obtaining of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">2 It is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted means of Grace and Bleſſing to them.</note> grace. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. <hi>A new heart wil I give you, &amp;c.</hi> compare this with <hi>verſe</hi> 27. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I will yet for this be ſought</hi> (or inquired of) <hi>by the houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael to doe it for them.</hi> God will give even firſt grace, in the uſe of his own appointed meanes, and that is in a way of ſeeking for it. Hence alſo God owneth this as his own appointed meanes for obtaining other bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of his, as deliverance from dangers,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:46945:203"/> ſupplies of wants, and the like, albeit the perſons which pray are unregenerate. So when Sea-men of all ſorts, whether ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or godly, are in ſtormes and dangers, they cry <hi>unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their diſtreſſe,</hi> Pſalm 107. 23. 28. If it were ſimply ſinful in them, being unregenerate, to cry and pray to God, he would never thus incourage them or others in their caſe to cry then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26, 5. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah ſought God in the dayes of Zechariah,</hi> and when he ſought the Lord, God made him for to proſper; if he had been downright godly, he had ſought God all his dayes: yet though an hypocrite (ſo unregenerate) as long as he doth that which is for the matter of it right in Gods ſight, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. (which is expounded <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>He ſought God) God proſpereth him. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah did what was right in Gods ſight, as Amaziah his father did,</hi> which was not with a perfect heart for the manner of doing it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 2. yet ſeeking of God even by ſuch a one, whoſe heart is not perfect with God, is in it ſelf conſidered, that which is right in Gods ſight, and a due and direct means to proſper, in what ſuch a one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in hand. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 27. <hi>When he</hi>

That ſlothful ſervant, albeit a Reprobate, yet having ſuch a like gift and Talent, he is damned for not improving it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 30.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 That practice or religious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance <note place="margin">4.

<pb n="375" facs="tcp:46945:204"/> or Tranſgreſſion of ſome rule of God, it could not be ſin:) but the omiſſion or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of prayer, or calling upon God, even by Unregenerate perſons, is charged upon them by God as their ſin; therefore the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that ſervice of calling upon God was their Duty. The Aſſumption is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, when the Apoſtle would prove the unregenerate Jew and Gentile to bee under ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3 9. he proveth it <hi>ver.</hi> 11. by this, out of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 14. 2. <hi>There is none that underſtandeth, there is none that ſeeketh after God.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 4. The workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity have it charged upon their very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, as that which they cannot but know to be their ſin, <hi>that they call not upon God: Do not the workers of iniquity know, that they eat up my people as bread? They call not upon God;</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 4.

To like purpoſe we might argue, That the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of it by the Unregenerate, as well as Regenerate Jewes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is bewayled by <hi>Daniel,</hi> as their ſin: <hi>ergo,</hi> the contrary was their Duty, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>All this is come upon us, yet made we not our prayer to God.</hi> Beſides
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:46945:205"/> alſo, if it had not been in it ſelf good, and a duty, even for an Unregenerate perſon to pray, but had been in it ſelfe ſinful; the Pſalmiſt never need to have made that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation againſt him in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. 7. <hi>Let his prayer be turned into ſin.</hi> Beſides, the Pſalmiſt would never have urged God ſo to affright and perſecute his enemies by his judgments, that they might at length be forced to ſeek his name, if it had been in it ſelf ſinful, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83. 15, 16.</p>

For to the impure and unbelieving is nothing pure, Titus</hi> 1. 15, 16. But it is ſo in reſpect of the defects of other qualifications, required to the holy uſe and exerciſe of ſuch things; namely, want of faith, love to God, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for ſin, <hi>&amp;c. Their Sacrifices were an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Iſaiah 1. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. yet in themſelves commanded duties, and enjoyned to every Jew, whether he were Unregenerate or Regenerate. God once inabled <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, to call upon him; and though hee and we in him are become Bankrupts, and diſabled to do that ſervice and homage, yet our Lord and Maſter may, and doth require

It is every ones duty to underſtand, and ſo to believee in God, as well as to ſeek him; but the omiſſion of that Duty of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and believing God, hindereth not, but that the omiſſion of that other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſeeking God becometh a ſin to every one. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 9. 11.</p>

Hence Chriſt who knew the ſpirit of this Phariſee in his praiſes of God, rendreth him thus, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 14. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever exalteth himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 The main in their eyes, and ſo in their thanks, is ſome inherent excellency, not thoſe imputed mercies, not Chriſt and his Righteouſneſſe, and propitiation, and the pardon of ſin, Gods favour, acceptance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No word of theſe in the Phariſees thanks, but that <hi>I am not as others, unjuſt, I faſt, I pay Tithes,</hi> &amp;c. They are the Saints,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:46945:206"/> whoſe hearts being moſt affected with thoſe mercies, do break out into cordial praiers for them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Such men uſe to reſt in ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon eminencies and excellencies above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The Phariſee paſſeth others, he <hi>is not as other men,</hi> and that ſufficeth him: no word of a ſerious petition for the ſupply of ſuch or ſuch wants, of this or that grace, or for the increaſe thereof, or for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of ſuch or ſuch corruptions. Hee grounds his rejoycing upon anothers falling ſhort of him, upon others falls into ſuch ſins from which he is reſtrained; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 4. He <hi>ſhall have rejoicing in himſelf, and not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 Such men reſpect more the gift, then the Giver, and truſt more in that, then in him. They truſt in themſelves that they are righteous, when they ſay, <hi>God, we thank thee,</hi> Luke 18. 9, 11. compared. They make the gifts their God, and they adore and admire the Giver onely for the gifts ſake, and do not admire the gifts for the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſake, as true Converts, and Spouſe like ſpirits uſe to do, but harlot like they do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Such men are very ambitious in their thankful acknowledgments. They make Gods praiſes but as a ſtirrup to get up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mens eſteemes, and as a bridg by which to convey to themſelves humane praiſes; Hence this Temple acknowledgement,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:46945:207"/> and in the moſt conſpicuous place of it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Such men will in the midſt of their thankſgivings, be with heart and mouth too (ſometimes) cenſuring, and putting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon others, falling ſhort (as they conceive) of their excellencies; yea, albeit thoſe others be better men then themſelvs, as this gracious Publicane was, then the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee: ſo ſaith this ſeemingly thankful Phariſee, <hi>God I thank thee, I am not as this Publicane,</hi> not ſuch a varlet, not ſuch a wretch, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Unregenerate men may be carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out with ſome faith, as well as fervency in their praiers. As <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 12, 13, 14, <note place="margin">3 They may pray with ſome kind of faith.</note> 15, 17. The nine, as well as the tenth, who was truly gracious, cry as loud as he, and believe as ſtrongly upon the word of Chriſt as he, that the Lord Jeſus had granted their requeſt of healing, and goe a great way to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as men already cured, to ſhew themſelves to the Prieſt (as the manner then was) when yet they were not then actually cured; they ſet forward in the journey upon that errand, upon confidence of Chriſts word, as if they had been cured at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inſtant wherein he ſpake, and yet not at that very inſtant, but afterward, even as they journeied towards <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from that part of <hi>Samaria,</hi> were they actually cured. As an unregenerate man, one who hath not love, may have the gift of the faith of miracles, ſo as to remove mountaines. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2. So may they exerciſe that faith in ſuch
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:46945:207"/> a way expecting anſwers of prayer in caſes of wonder. They that caſt out devils did it by invocation upon the name of the Lord, accompanied with ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> faith for hearing them, and helping them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>And in thy name caſt out devils.</hi> And as an unregenerate man may have that common temporary faith, <hi>believe for a time. Luke</hi> 8. 13. So may he for ſuch a time act ſuch a faith in prayer, or the like, albeit it be in matters onely of a common nature, and not ſuch as are properly ſaving; as for clearing up pardon of ſins, ſubduing ſecret corruptions, ſanctifying of afflictions, an holy reſcue or iſſue from temptations, or the like.</p>
                  <p>Touching the third thing propounded, <note place="margin">God may be ſaid in ſome ſenſe to heare their prayers, praying with others.</note> I ſay, God may in ſome ſort, and in ſome caſes heare unregenerate mens prayers; both ſuch prayers as they put up to the Lord with others, or by themſelves alone. Prayers put up by them with others, may be heard in a ſaving way and manner by the Lord; albeit not in a ſaving manner to themſelves, yet in a ſaving way to the Saints which joyne with them in the praiers which they put up. <hi>Matthew (chap.</hi> 3. 5, 6) ſaith, <hi>the Centurion came unto Chriſt beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him to heale his ſervant,</hi> but <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 3, 4, 5. expoundeth it, that <hi>he ſent to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Jewes to beſeech Chriſt to doe it.</hi> He joyned with them in the requeſt, it was his, but it was preſented by thoſe proud hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical and unregenerate Elders, who brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed

Abiathar,</hi> who proved a treacherous and bad man, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 26.) yet if he made inquiry of God for his counſel about diſtreſſed <hi>David,</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 7, 8.) or about <hi>David</hi> in a ſtrait, (2 <hi>Sam</hi> 2. 1.)

<pb n="383" facs="tcp:46945:208"/> prayers, wherein believers joyne, or in their owne alone. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 145 19. <hi>He will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the deſire of them that feare him:</hi> The fruit of no one ordinance of God doth depend meerly and onely upon the worthineſſe and goodneſſe of ſuch as chiefly act in it. Chriſt authouriſed the twelve Diſciples, and <hi>Judas</hi> among the reſt, <hi>to preach the Goſpel. Matth.</hi> 10 4. 7. And ſo, as that if they came to worthy ones, humble ſoules, ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their doctrine, <hi>their peace was to come upon them, verſe</hi> 13. <hi>If the houſe be worthy, let your ptace come upon it,</hi> even all kind of bliſſe to their ſouls alſo, which you petition for in your prayers, and hold forth in your preaching, that ſhall come upon it.

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:46945:210"/> that he might the rather incourage all ſorts to pray to him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 2. <hi>O thou that heareſt prayers, to thee ſhall all fleſh come.</hi> Sometimes the perſons at preſent unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, yet are elect, and God in hearing them, will look to his owne thoughts of prayer which hee hath towards them, and ſo will be found of thoſe which ſought him not aright.</p>
                  <p>But in caſe the parties bee reprobates, what hearing God doth afford to any pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of theirs.</p>
                  <p>It is firſt in common things, and ſuch, which (at leaſt) are not properly <note place="margin">In common, not in things properly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</note> ſaving mercies unto them, for ſo God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not ſinners: if any object, that evil ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants pardon, granted upon his requeſt. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 32.

An implacable ſpirited Chriſtian is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in a ſtate of damnation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The hearing which the Lord doth <note place="margin">By God as a Maſter, not as a Father.</note> lend to ſuch, is from his general providence and pity, and rather as a Soveraigne and Maſter, then from any particular grace,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:46945:210"/> and as a Father; for ſo he heareth not ſinners, yea he heareth them, rather to leave them without excuſe, and to take a fuller blow at them afterwards, as in the caſe of that evill ſervant, <hi>Matthew</hi> 18. the end.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lord uſeth not to give any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <note place="margin">They receive not Grace anſwerable.</note> grace as the ſucceſs of their prayers; ſo he heareth onely Saints, and not ſinners, eſpecially reprobates; he changed not the ſervants heart with his condition, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. nor theirs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 37, 38, 39.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God ſometimes heareth them in <note place="margin">They are heard in wrath.</note>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Touching Distractions in Prayer.</head>
                  <p>VVE are now to proceed to other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Conſcience, ariſing in the inceſſant carrying on of the weighty duty of prayer. The ſecond caſe now to be handled
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:46945:211"/> is, touching Diſtractions, or Impertinent thoughts, and workings of ſpirit, which diſturb and moleſt us in prayer: wherein, demand will be made of three things.</p>
                  <p>Touching, 1 The Cauſes 2 The Cure <label type="milestone">

                     </label> or remedy thereof. 3 The ſucceſſe of ſuch prayers, wherein ſuch diſtractions are found.</p>
                  <p>Touching the firſt we ſay, the cauſes <note place="margin">General cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in prayer.</note> of ſuch diſtractions are either ſuch as are more generall or more particular. The more general cauſes are two.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Satan that enemy to prayer, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of all confuſion, and ſo of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion <note place="margin">Satan.</note> of the ſpirit in prayer; that fowle who ſtealeth away what is ſpoken to the heart by God in the word, he is as buſie to ſteal away the good motions of the ſpirit, ſtirring us up to ſpeak to God in prayer. Satan is at hand to tempt when we are in hand with prayer. If we will draw near to God in prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we may expect the tempter to approach ſome way or other to diſturb us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by ſome ſiniſter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſuggeſtions or other. Wee muſt reſiſt the devil in ſuch like diſtracting motions when we are drawing nigh to God. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Reſiſt the devil, and he will flee from you.</hi> And <hi>verſe</hi> 8. <hi>Draw near to God, &amp;c.</hi> If wee will pray with all manner of prayer, we had need be armed againſt ſuch like wily aſſaults of Satan, which tend to annoy us therin. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 11, 18. compared. Look as <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 16, 17, 18. ſtill when the Apoſtle and his company were to go to prayer, the devil in his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:46945:211"/> the maid poſſeſſed, maketh a diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance with her impertinent ſpeeches; ſo is it here, if the devil can help it, ſome thing or other ſhall be ſet on work to breed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, or occaſion diſturbance to us in prayer, or he himſelfe will be ſuggeſting ſomething to moleſt us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The unregenerate part of man. When <note place="margin">2 The unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate part in man.</note> at any time we ſhould doe any good, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to pray, or the like, evil will bee preſent with us, as he complained. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21. <hi>When I would do good, evil is preſent with me:</hi> that ſink of natural corruption will then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially caſt out its unſavory ſmels, when ſo raked into by holy humble acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and deprecations, this dunghill will then be ſending out his vapours, even when the heart is heated and warmed in prayer by the ſpirit; when a commanding power of grace is ſtirring in the heart, the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate part will be raiſing theſe munities. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. <hi>I ſee another law in my members, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt the law of my mind: Paul</hi> found it ſo, and who doth not find it ſo in continual experience? If the ſpirit doe break any long ſilence in the heart, and will bee ſpeaking, corruption will talk as loud as the ſpirit, and if it can, drown the noiſe and voice of the ſpirit, that the heart may not diſtinctly hear what the ſpirit doth teach the heart to ſpeak to the Lord. The fleſh will be luſting againſt the ſpirit, ſo that wee cannot ſpeak to God, or doe any ſervice
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:46945:212"/> for him, in ſo free and ſpiritual manner as we (as regenerate) doe deſire. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. All evill thoughts which boyle out of the ſpirit, riſe out of that inward ſpring, and ſo theſe evil thoughts which diſturb us in prayer, they ſpring from the ſame fountain, <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. 21. <hi>out of the heart proceed evill thoughts, &amp;c.</hi> The unregenerate part in the beſt, ſavoureth not ſuch a ſpiritual way of God, as is the conſcionable exerciſe of our ſelves in prayer, that begetteth that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſlipperineſſe in ſpiritual things, whence it is that good motions are not ſo rooted, and dwell not ſo long with us. This is that which would be breeding and feeding a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the beſt, to be ſoon ſatisfied with ſpiritual things, and ſo to abate of the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and intent purſuit after the ſame. The ſtrength of this natural By as will too oft ſhew it ſelfe in the Saints, that whilſt their ſpirits are carried out with ſome might of the hand of the ſpirit of God towards the mark in prayer, this draweth the mind away, and the deceitfull heart of many will bee ſlyly flinging ſomething or other in the way to cauſe a rub, and to ſlack or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the ſtrait courſe of a regenerate man in prayer.</p>
                  <p>More particular cauſes of ſuch diſtractions <note place="margin">Particular cauſes thereof.</note> in prayer, are theſe:</p>

<pb n="393" facs="tcp:46945:213"/> the mind is in a manner drunk with cares of this life, it will go on reeling and ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering in the choiceſt paths of God: or if from ſuch a worldly ſpirit, we make raſh and ſudden irruptions unto Prayer from heat of worldly buſineſſes, when the mind but then was reaking hot, and ſweating in them, the ſteem and ſavour thereof will ſurely annoy us in prayer ſo ſoon after: our buſineſſes, which we talked with ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but then, they will be calling after us again, as having ſomewhat more to ſay to us. The Veſſels of our minds will taſte too much of that ſtrong liquor, which can hardly be emptied out ſo ſoon. Look as it is with a man, who is not throughly waked from ſleep, his head is moſt apt to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with fumes, and his tongue to ſpeak im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently: ſo is it here, when we are not throughly rowzed from carnal occaſions and thoughts about them; our minds will be full of impertinent thoughts.

The ground of diſcontent is diſtruſt:
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:46945:214"/> and what is of a more wavering nature then that? It maketh a man like the troubled ſea when it cannot reſt ſo long as ſuch blaſts are upon his mind.

So is it here, when ſpiritual and heavenly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Chriſtians are to trade with God in prayer, they preſent little elſe to the Lord then what is ſpiritual and ſutable to their work in hand. <hi>Out of the good Treaſure of their hearts, they bring forth good things, Matth.</hi> 12. 35. yea, good thoughts too, as well as words; whereas a more worldly minded Chriſtian, when to pray, preſents little elſe but what ſavours of the world, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in his thoughts: as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 37. 31, its ſaid of the ſpiritual perſon, <hi>The Law of God is in his heart, none of his ſteps ſhall ſlide:</hi> no not ſo oft or much ſlip, when to go on in this or any other path of God. God himſelf is more engaged to keep ſuch a heart from wandring from any of his
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:46945:220"/> Commandments which is devoted to him. Hence that plea of his, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 10. <hi>With my whole heart have I ſought thee, O let me not wander from thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5 Holy Zeal. When there is an holy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency <note place="margin">5. Holy Zeal.</note> of indignation againſt the leaſt evil and impenitency ariſing in prayer, its a means to redreſſe the ſame. When Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do not barely fal out with any ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but abhor it, hate evil as hell, (as the Greek word in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 9. ſignifieth) then will they more immoveably cleave to this or any other good, for they are joyned there; <hi>Abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good,</hi> or be glued to that which is good, ſo as not to be ſtirred from it. A zealous Suppliant eſpying any ſuch imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency in prayer, preſently falleth fowl of it, cryeth out upon it, purſueth it with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, cenſureth it in all its aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſo gaineth more intentneſs of ſpirit, and ſeriouſneſſe of lively affections in the duty then before. Zeal is bold and couragious, and will not baſely yeild to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch intruder, but thruſt them out of doors, looking at them as attended with a whole crowd of other like diſturbers, ready to preſſe in at their heels, if once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted entrance into the ſoul of a Chriſtian exerciſed in prayer. Look as the cutting or cropping off unprofitable ſprouts, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth here or there, upon their firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:46945:220"/> cauſeth the tree to grow the ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to bring forth more ſeaſonable fruit. So is it here, when by Zeal we cut off impertinencies at their firſt appearing, we bring forth more ſeaſonably the fruits of every praying grace and diſpoſition. And look as 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 32, 33. when they were ſerious in that weighty diſcourſe, there was charge given to handle that turbulent meſſenger roughly at the door, to prevent his Mſtaers coming in at his heels. So is it here, when at this pious conference with God, any ſuch unſeaſonable motions are zealouſly repulſed, it preventeth more ſad diſturbance in the duty. Albeit <hi>Abrahams</hi> zeal could not hinder the fowls from light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Sacrifice, yet will it not ſuffer them to reſt there, but driveth them away, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 10, 11. Zeal alſo will make a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtian remove all cauſes and occaſions of diſturbance: As <hi>Paul,</hi> out of his zeal uſeth meanes to caſt the divel out of the poſſeſſed maid, which occaſioned that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance daily to them when they went to praier, <hi>Act.</hi> 16 16, 17 18. <hi>As we went to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a certain damſel poſſeſſed, &amp;c. cryed, &amp;c. and Paul being grieved in ſpirit, ſaid to the ſpirit, Come out of her.</hi>

If the bloud of Chriſt doth not ſpeak ſuch good things which further in us prayer, the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> or the guilt of ſin, will ſpeak that which will ſtartle us and ſtumble us whilſt at prayer: and the poor ſoul will be more taken up with liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to theſe cryes, and with perplexed thoughts what anſwer to make to ſuch pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Objections thence, then be able to hold out its attentions to what he was to ſpeak further unto the Lord.

When the heart is ſhackled with ſuch bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding griefs and fears, it cannot go, much leſſe run ſo ſturdily in this, or any other way of God, but will be blundring and ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering in mind and heart: whereas peace and joy in God, they fit and free us for a ſteady and ſpeedy motion in this or any other way

                  <p>That ſuch motions may come from our <note place="margin">They may ariſe from mans deceitful heart.</note> own hearts, as they are carnal, will appear by the charactar of mans heart in its ſelfe conſidered, and as far as natural, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9. <hi>The heart is deceitfull above all things, and deſperately wicked.</hi> Surely, if the heart could not play ſuch a cheat as this, that ſpeech would bee too hyperbolical.

A miſtaken de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill entertained for an angel of light is moſt miſcheivous, and not eaſily excluded, when once admittted. Such comfort or counſell ſlyly ſuggeſted, will not ſo ſoon be rejected, but being admitted for good, is apt to be maintained.

When a man in prayer hath his imagination working and exerciſed about good notions for godly diſcourſe, for expatiating on ſome good ſubject of meditation or preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that in ſuch ſort, as he cannot, and doth not mind ſcarcely what hee is ſaying or doing before God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, theſe thoughts and motions are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Such motions as come into the heart <note place="margin">2. When they are too violent</note> with ſuch violence, that they occaſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hurries of ſpirit by them, and thereby breaking off the very duty ſometimes; theſe though materially good, yet are deluſive and ſatanical. As when in prayer ſtrong motions are ſuggeſted, pretending to put us upon being affected with ſorrow for ſome paſt evil, or fear about ſome evil imminent, yet ſo, as the ſame are preſſed and followed with ſuch violence that they bend and tend to amazement and ſwallowing up of ſpirits, theſe are deluſive. Such were thoſe motions in <hi>Aſaphs</hi> heart, whilſt ſeeking God, which ſo troubled him, that he was overwhelmed, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 77. 2 <hi>In the day of my trouble I ſought God;</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>I complained and my ſpirit was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed.</hi>

Yea, if the motions were to confidence in God, or joy in God, but with ſuch violence, as to drive men into ſtrange extaſies, they are to be ſuſpected. So in motions puting upon juſt anger for the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:46945:231"/> ground of it; but with ſo much violence as not to be kept within bounds of godly moderation, and temperature of compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo in motions putting upon deſires of ſomething in its time, way, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion very deſirable; but ſo all upon the ſpur, and with ſo much imperiouſneſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſpirit, as though all preſent ſervice of God, and all other thoughts, muſt forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with give room and place to this motion, which is enough to prove the ſame to bee deluſive; the Spirit of God uſing to work regularly and calmly, even when he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moſt ſtrongly. Sure it is, that it is not one and the ſame Spirit, that ſpeaketh to a mans ſpirit, which whilſt it was but then called upon to ſpeak to the Lord about ſuch a buſineſſe of weight, it is now in ſuch haſte and hurry called off to run a long tract of mental diſcourſe, ſo hotly and ſo cloſely, with ſome other matter: but Chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter like rather, coming galloping to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the honeſt Traveller, and falling in with him, he muſt all on a ſudden, be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intreated to ſtep aſide to take his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and then he ſhall be told he ſhall on again, and diſpatch his buſineſs in time good enough; when it proveth rather to the poor Travellers loſs in the cloſe on every hand.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Such motions, which are empty no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, carrying a ſhew of Scripture language, <note place="margin">3. When they are but empty notions.</note> but are not Scripture; haply ſome piece of Scripture joyned with ſomething elſe,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:46945:231"/> whereof the main is left out: So the Divel at firſt ſight ſeemed to ſuggeſt that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91. 11, 12, <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee,</hi> &amp;c. Matth. 4. 6. but look it over again, and you ſhall ſee the main limitation of the Promiſe, <hi>To keep thee in all thy wayes,</hi> is left out; as ſomething is added of the Divels owne in bringing this to back the temptation of Chriſt, <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down, for it is written, He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee,</hi> &amp;c. Thus here is chaff mingled with Gods Wheat. Yea here is a pretence of a Scripture, when in the terms of it there was no ſuch Scripture. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the divel, or in his Inſtruments mouth, is as the <hi>Parable in the fools mouth, Prov.</hi> 26. 7. Like to the legs of the lame, which are not equal, but halting. It is pretended, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> by the falſe Prophets, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 17.

The divels Imps, to

So Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan himſelf would be beguiling of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans with his deluſive ſhadowes of Gods grace, counſels, comforts; but they who <hi>hearken to ſuch lying vanities forſake their own mercy,</hi> Jonah 2. 8. But ſuch things which the Holy Ghoſt ſuggeſteth, they are realities, regularities, ſolidities. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſuggeſtions carry a real port of divine Majeſty and Soveraignty, and many times in the very mentioning of them doth he effect what he repreſented to the mind. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 8 <hi>The Lord will command his loving kindneſs in the day time,</hi> (and not barely hint it;) yea ſo effectually, that a Song of praiſe for it followeth, <hi>And my Song ſhall be with me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Thus the Divel by the falſe Prophet pretends divine Authority and Warrant, for that which was directly contrary to Divine Authority. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 28. 11, 14. <hi>Hannaniah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Babels yoak ſhall be broken in two years,</hi> and that the Lord ſaith it; but God by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>No:</hi> and as Satan doth thus mediately by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, ſo he uſeth to do more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by himſelf: But as for the Spirit of God, he being a Spirit of Truth, can ſuggeſt nothing but what is conſonant unto truth; <hi>What he heareth</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that he ſhall ſpeak,</hi> Joh. 16. 13.

But whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver flatterings he maketh in mens minds, they are but vagrant and tranſcient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings; but its otherwiſe with ſuggeſtions truly divine. When ſuch a motion and word is ſpoken from heaven to Chriſt, <hi>Thou art my Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 21, 22. and <hi>the Spirit abideth upon him</hi> too, that argued that it was indeed a divine atteſtation, <hi>John</hi> 1. 32.

So in that <hi>Item</hi> of God to <hi>Paul</hi> whilſt he was praying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9. <hi>He ſayd to me, my grace is ſufficient for thee, my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſſe:</hi> this ſo ſtuck with <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſo warmed him, that he breaketh out thus; <hi>moſt gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, &amp;c.</hi> he rightly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concluded that the Lord ſayd thus unto him. <hi>Whilſt Jacob is wreſtling with the Lord, that is told him, that he ſhould prevail with men.

Both the means and the mercies which we obtain in and by prayer, with uſe of means, are more ſutable to our humane condition here; when means are uſed by us, we are often minded of the mercies received thereby, by like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and means occurring, and are fitter to mind others thereof occaſionally.</p>

So did <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> his petition to the King was ſanctified by his petition to the King of heaven, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2. 4, 5. <hi>So I prayed unto the God of heaven, and then I ſaid unto the King, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 21. thoſe godly <hi>Jews</hi> ſought God by faſting and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for a right way of proceeding in their return into <hi>Judea. Aſa</hi> will ſet the battel in aray, as the means, but yet ſanctifie it by praier, and yet then alſo profeſſe, it is all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. 10. 11 <hi>We have no power, help us O Lord our God.</hi> And indeed when Chriſtians ſanctifie the means by prayer, they acknowledg God as All in All, even in the means as well as the end; this will prevent uſing of unlawful means. If <hi>Abraham, Iſaak, Rebecca,</hi> and
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:46945:239"/> 
                     <hi>Jacob</hi> had done ſo, they had not uſed thoſe poor ſhifts mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. and 20. and 26. and 27. no better then lying. Beſides, it will prevent a blaſt upon that which meanes may bring about without ſuch pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſanctifie the ſame: when we uſe means with ſucceſs in our deſires, without prayer, we either want the comfort of the thing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, or it is unexpectedly ſnatched from us; or it is ſome way perverted to ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable uſe or rather abuſe thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Be we choice, prudent, and pious in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of the means, we pitch upon, and <note place="margin">2. Uſe the beſt means.</note> as pious and prudent in the manner of uſing the ſame. Neither chuſe nor uſe any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful means, as <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Sarai</hi> did, to give their maids to their husbands, to attain their deſire of children by them. Or as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in danger at <hi>Gath,</hi> ſupplicating for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, but ſcrabling too as the meanes. Nor are we to uſe any unſutable or unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable means, or lawful pertinent means unlawfully or unſeaſonably, but uſe lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and likelieſt means. As <hi>Mordecai</hi> with prayer uſed Queen <hi>Eſthers</hi> intereſt with her husband King <hi>Ahaſhuerus;</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> with his prayer ſends <hi>Eſau</hi> a Preſent, a gift uſing to proſper whitherſoever it goeth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Look we that there lye no fault or ſin upon us, in ſuch ſort as might blaſt both our <note place="margin">3. Remove what might blaſt the means</note> praying and means uſing alſo. As in <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> crying whilſt <hi>Achans</hi> ſin lay upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Why cryeſt thou?—Iſraet hath ſinned, &amp;c.</hi> So the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:46945:240"/> for avenging that horrid crime of <hi>Beja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, Judg.</hi> 19. gather an Army, and pray too; but for ſins among them, and too much tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to their numbers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> twice blaſted, <hi>Judg.</hi> 20. Hence when godly <hi>Ezra</hi> would uſe means for their ſafe return to <hi>Judea,</hi> he putteth his company upon ſolemn humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of themſelves before God, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. leſt their ſins might way-lay them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Uſe the means in faith. Set faith on <note place="margin">4. Uſe means in faith.</note> work, as well in the uſe of means as of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> prayeth, ſetteth a ſtrict watch, encourageth all ſorts to fight, but all in faith, <hi>Our God ſhal fight for us.</hi> Neh. 4. 9, 13, 14. compared. <hi>Moſes cryeth,</hi> Ex. 14. 15. ſo did the people, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 9. and withal <hi>Moſes</hi> uſeth means preſcribed of God for to paſſe thorow the red ſea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 26. <hi>he ſtretcheth out his hand over the red ſea to divide it;</hi> but all this was in faith, looking through all their prayers, and all ſecondary means, unto the Lord as All in All: <hi>By faith they paſſed through the red ſea,</hi> Heb. 11. 29. <hi>Aſa</hi> ſetteth the battle in array, and prayeth, but reſteth neither on his war-like power nor on his prayers, but on the Lord alone, <hi>We reſt on thee,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 14. 10. 11. And indeed wee have need to uſe means in faith, looking through means and reſting on the God of them, and on his promiſe for ſucceeding the ſame. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> prayeth as well after he had pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the means of pacifying <hi>Eſau</hi> as before, and yet reſteth on the charge of God that he ſhould return; and his promiſe <hi>That he wil</hi>

Many weights are oft-times upon our ſpirits to preſs them down, which are not ſo eaſily removed; many bonds, yea knots in theſe cords, ſtraitning our ſpirit, which are not not eaſily unloſed, we need enlargment of our hearts to run any ſuch way of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. We would, as men ſometimes in their ſleep, faine cry, but there is ſuch a weight upon our breſts that wee cannot; deadneſs ſeizeth upon us, and much rubbing is needful ere life is recovered: dulneſs annoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, and much whetting is requiſite ere our hearts get a ſpiritual edg upon them: we may ſay with the Church, <hi>Quicken us, ſo will we call upon thee,</hi> Pſa. 81. 18. and as <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10. 7 If the iron be blunt, the more pains is taken to ſharpen it, ſo it is here with our blunt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in prayer.</p>

If the Inſtrument of a Chriſtians ſpirit be not wel tuned in prayer, truly he wil make but bad muſick of it all the day after in his calling and imployments.

Sickneſſe alloweth but little reſpit and free ſpace for prayer. Other work of the poor ſoul is ſo various then, and perplexing, that it taketh up the whole man to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch that. And indeed when ſincere ones have not long to live, they are the fitter for prayer. When the Saints are neer the Ocean of Eternity, then the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets of Grace in their ſoules wax ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

That we muſt uſe holy pleas in prayer. 2. What pleas we may uſe therein. 3. What Rules we are to attend unto in our pleading with God in prayer.</p>
                  <p>Now firſt, that we may and muſt plead <note place="margin">That we muſt plead in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> with God in prayer, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. 18. God ſaith to penitent ones, <hi>Come let us reaſon toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> God reaſoneth with us by his word and providences, outwardly; and by the motions of his ſpirit, inwardly: but we reaſon with him, by framing (through the help of his Spirit) certain holy argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:46945:248"/> grounded upon allowed princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, drawn from his nature, name, word, or works: And it is condemned as a very ſinfull defect in profeſſours, that they did not plead the Churches caſe with God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 13. <hi>There is none to plead thy cauſe, that thou mayeſt be bound up.</hi> If you perſue the examples of the moſt famous &amp; prevailing ſuppliants of God, recorded in Scripture roules, you ſhall finde them uſing holy pleas in their prayers for themſelves or others. Thus did <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> 18. 25. <hi>Shall not the judge of the whole earth doe right?</hi> So <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32. 9, 12, 13. <hi>Which ſaideſt, return to thy Fathers houſe. And ſaideſt, ſurely I will doe thee good.</hi> Which is, as if he had ſaid, Lord, I undertook not the journey upon my own head, but thou badeſt me goe, and I have thy word for a good ſucceſſe: and therefore I look thou ſhouldſt beare me harmleſſe, and bleſſe me in this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. So <hi>Moſes, David, Daniel,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, their prayers are full of holy pleas. And that we may ſtrengthen this by two or three reaſons, conſider: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1 Its an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with God.</note> acquaintance, and friendſhip thus to plead with God in prayer: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt ſuitable to this holy talking with God. As men uſe to plead with ſuch as they are moſt intimate withall, ſo is it here: Hence the Saints, which have been
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46945:248"/> men inward with the Lord, to whom he hath made himſelfe moſt known, and opened his mind and boſome to them, and they theirs to him; they ever uſe the moſt pleas with God in their prayers. What meere men more intimate with God, then <hi>Abraham, Moſes,</hi> and <hi>David?</hi> and who pleaded it more ſtoutly &amp; freely with him, then they did. This is a branch of that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which we have through Chriſt, and it being ſo deare a bought priviledge, we may wel improve it to the utmoſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>By whom we have free acceſse with confidence. Heb.</hi> 10. 19. <hi>By the blood of Jeſus we have acceſſe with boldneſs unto the holy place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will be an argument of fervency <note place="margin">2 Of Fervency</note> and holy ſeriouſneſſe in our ſpirits in prayer, to back the ſame with prevailing pleas. As it is in all petitioners amongſt men, ſuing for things they moſt ſtrongly deſire.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It will be an argument of our careful and ſerious minding, and recording of <note place="margin">3.

God may and doth beſtow upon his people many deſirable bleſſings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much a doe, in pleading for them: The penitent thiefe did but ſay, <hi>Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me when thou commeſt into thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and Chriſt preſently anſwered him, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe. Luke</hi> 23. 42, 43. and the Publican did but cry, <hi>Lord be mercifull to me a ſinner,</hi> and he went away juſtified, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13, 14. And <hi>David</hi> did but in a ſhort ejaculatory <note place="margin">Pſal. 3</note> way ſeek the Lord, and he delivered him from all his feares.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Some extraordinary examples
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:46945:251"/> doe not take away from the force and courſe of an ordinary rule, in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of prayer, nor any other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The caſes of the Saints may be ſuch, and ſo circumſtantiated, that a few bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken expreſſions may be as much, yea more in them, and from them, then many pleas in themſelves or others, in other caſes, and at other times. As in the poor thiefe, incompaſſed with ſo much ſenſe of guilt of his former leud courſes, with bodily tortures, feare of death, &amp;c. So in <hi>David,</hi> in that inſtant when he changed his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour before <hi>Abimelech, Pſal.</hi> 34. <hi>title.</hi> So in caſes of poore tempted Saints, under bonds, bolts, and keepers, (as it were) and with heavy weights upon their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>They make ſhort cries in depths,</hi> Pſal. 130. 1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God wil ſometimes order paſſages for peculiar examples of his royall boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that none may glory in man, nor in prayers, nor in pleas, although acted therein by the ſpirit of grace: and that none may be diſmayed, albeit they cannot ſometimes plead the caſes of their ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Scripture in recording the Saints prayers, doth not alwaies expreſſe all, but rather ſetteth down the ſumme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what was uttered by them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In ſhort prayers there may be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched many pleas, as in that of the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans prayer, wherein almoſt every word
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:46945:251"/> includeth a ſecret plea. As that term of [Lord] is a plea of reſpect to an humble ſervants requeſt: ſo that [be propitious] includeth pleas from Gods own mercy, and Chriſts merits. So that [to me a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner] that is, chiefeſt of ſinners, it was a very plea for grace to him that was ſuch a one in his own ſight and ſenſe. To be ſure he had a pleading ſpirit in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. God is not as man to be moved by our pleas, but abideth unchangeable in his purpoſes of what he wil doe: ſo that as he ſaid to <hi>Samuel</hi> touching <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 1. <hi>Why mourneſt thou for Saul, ſeeing I have rejected him? God is not as man to repent,</hi> what pleas ſoever are made to the contrary, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 15. <hi>God anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth me not</hi> (ſaith <hi>Saul) neither by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim, nor by Prophets. Lord, Lord,</hi> (plead they in <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 25, 26.) <hi>have we not eaten and drunken in thy preſence?</hi> And <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 21, 22, 23. <hi>Have we not propheſied in thy name, and in thy name caſt out divels?</hi> but both in vain: <hi>I know you not</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Its true, Amidſt Gods divers expreſſings of himſelfe to us, ſometimes as frowning, ſometimes as ſmiling, there is no change with God; God is the ſame when he carrieth it to us as willing, or when as unwilling to hearken to us: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by an immutable act of his counſel he ordered it to carry it ſo diverſly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:46945:252"/> us in his diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Its true alſo that there is nothing done in time, but the Lord decreed it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably before all time; as that he would confer upon his people ſuch and ſuch a mercy, but in ſuch a way of moving them to pray and plead for it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Its true alſo that there is a time when pleas availe not: as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For a time: and ſo the Lord may expreſſe diſtaſte, and carry it as one that is angry with his own, yea when pleading in prayer. The Church plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. 1. <hi>Heare:</hi> why ſo? <hi>O thou ſhepheard of Iſrael</hi> &amp;c. yet <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulateth, <hi>Why art thou ſo long angry with the prayers of thy people?</hi> yet were their pleas, and prayers, and teares treaſured up for a fit ſeaſon of help.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For ever: namely in caſe of expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and ending of the date of the day and ſeaſon of grace with any, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 28. <hi>They ſhall ſeek me early, and not finde me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Albeit the Lord be not moved by our pleas; yet are our pleas his ordinance, and therefore we are to attend thereto: and they are an ordinary way and meanes, in the uſe whereof God will give promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mercies; yea, they are a means which the Spirit of God maketh uſe of to move and quicken up our ſenſe and feeling of ſuch and ſuch wants, our deſire of ſuch
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:46945:252"/> and ſuch mercies, and our faith in ſuch and ſuch promiſes or attributes of God, (or the like) to put us upon the ſerious urging of ſuch and ſuch holy pleas in our prayers.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to the ſecond thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, namely, what pleas we are to uſe in our prayers to the Lord. There are in arguing the caſes and intricacies of our ſoules, ſpirituall Topick places (as I may call them) certaine radicall notions in God and Chriſt, and the Word, which yield fruitfull and forcible arguments, in this our holy diſcourſe and reaſoning with God: true it is, that it is not every puny in Chriſtianity that can raiſe ſo aply, ſeaſonably, ſtrongly, plentifully, and graciouſly, ſuch prevailing pleas: ſome are but Juniors and Freſhmen in the ſchoole of Chriſt; others are Senior Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in this holy Logick: there is much skill required to become one of Heavens Barriſters.</p>
                  <p>But for the better help and direction in <note place="margin">Pleas with God reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe, as from his own name.</note> this Art, and fruitfull practice thereof, let us reduce theſe pleas to three heads. Some reſpect God, ſome our ſelves, ſome others. Briefly then of ſome pleas reſpecting God, and there we finde the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording ſome approved, and (as I may ſay) unanſwerable pleas. As firſt, the engagement of his own name in the caſes before him. When a petitioner hath ſuch
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46945:253"/> skill in pleading his ſuit, that he can prudently involve the petitioned party in his caſe, and ſo make it as well the caſe of the petitioned, as of the petitioner: this with men is undeniable pleading; So is it here with God, thus <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 11, 12. <hi>Why doth thy wrath wax hot, &amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould the Aegyptians ſpeak and ſay, for miſchiefe did the Lord bring them out to ſlay them in the mountaine, &amp;c.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Lord, I ſay not how the name of thy grace, wiſdome, faithfulneſſe and long-ſuffering, may ſuffer in the eyes and hearts of thy profeſſed people, if thou ſhouldeſt deny my requeſt; but conſider what a diſparagement it wil be to thy glory, in the eyes of thy enemies, to deale ſo ſtrictly with thy people; men are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to lay a ſtumbling-block before the blind; and wil God lay ſuch an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of offence and falling in the way of blind Aegyptians. The like plea is uſed in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Help us for the glory of thy name, purge away our ſins for thy names ſake: wherefore ſhould the Heathen ſay, where is there God? Render to them the reproach wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 18. 19, 22. and in many other places to like purpoſe. The caſes wherein Gods name and glory is in any ſpecial ſort engaged, are of greateſt weight and concernment, and therefore none necd be afraid or aſhamed to plead
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46945:253"/> them in ſuch ſort before the Lord: in ſuch pleas truly, if the Lord ſhould deny his Saints, he ſhould deny himſelfe. And the ſelf-deniall of the Suppliant ſhines forth the more in ſuch pleas, when he pleads the caſe, not ſo much in reference to himſelfe, as to the Lord himſelfe, and to his name.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſuitableneſſe of the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">His relation to us and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to help us.</note> betwixt God and us, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79. 9. <hi>Help us, O God of our ſalvation. Deliver us for thy name ſake.</hi> As if they would ſay, thou ſtileſt thy ſelfe <hi>the God of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> we by thy grace doe eye and own thee as ſuch a one; wherefore ſhew that thou art ſuch a one by ſaving of us: let it appeare that it is no empty title. And what is more ſuitable to a God of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then to ſave his people? or wherein ſhall that Name of thine be more magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, then in thy delivering thy people? So <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 16. <hi>Doubtleſſe thou art our father, our Redeemer, &amp;c.</hi> As if they had ſaid, O Lord, we have no other but thee; of whom ſhould children ſeek for reliefe, or from whom ſhould they expect ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour but from their father? Now, we are reſolved to own no other for our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but thee, and can a father be curſt to his poor deſolate, diſconſolate, ſick, or ſad children, when it is in his power to relieve them? To this we may adde the ſuitableneſſe of the mercies we ask
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:46945:254"/> of God, unto him, and unto us. So <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 17, 18, 19. <hi>Let the power of my Lord be great, as thou haſt ſaid, the Lord is long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, &amp;c. pardon, I beſeech thee, the iniquity of thy people.</hi> As it is ſuitable to a ſinning people to get a pardon, ſo it is moſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a ſin-pardoning God, to give forth a pardon to them. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 4. <hi>But there are forgiveneſses with thee, that thou maiſt be feared.</hi> I need not ſpeak more in this caſe, or ſo much as ſcruple it, that thou ſhouldſt be ſtrict upon a poore deſolate tempted creature, to mark what is done amiſſe, and ſo to proceed to condemne or confound ſuch a one as I am; for there are Forgiveneſſes with thee: the manifold pardons that I need for my manifold and multiplied ſins, are in readineſſe in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance with thee: thou canſt not deny the benefit thereof to me in my caſe; I wil and do conclude it as a granted caſe, there are forgiveneſſes with thee: What then? that thou maiſt be feared. Thus the Faith of Heavens ſuppliants wil be coming within God, and wil be framing good conceits of God, and telling him how wel they are perſwaded of him, and of his generous nature, that if he deny them he ſhould diſparage himſelfe in their eyes, who had better thoughts of him. As <hi>Paul,</hi> deſiring <hi>Agrippa's</hi> becomming a Chriſtian, he windeth him in by his holy Rhetorick,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:46945:254"/> thus, <hi>Believeſt thou the Prophets? yea, I know thou believeſt:</hi> ſo that if <hi>Agrippa</hi> deny this, he muſt in a manner weaken his own eſteem: ſo when the Saints in their prayers and pleas hold forth their faith in God, as ſuch or ſuch an one, in his gracious nature, the Lord uſeth not to exerciſe himſelfe ſhort of their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions; but it is for his honour to make good the utmoſt of his peoples deſires and expectations of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the little gain that the Lord <note place="margin">The little gain the Lord wil have by our ruines.</note> would have by denying his people, in the mercies they requeſt. <hi>David</hi> beggeth his own life of God, uſing this plea, <hi>What profit is there in my blood? Pſal.</hi> 30. 9. So did the captive Church plead, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 12. <hi>Thou ſelleſt thy people for nought, and doſt not increaſe thy wealth thereby.</hi> So then, poor Saints of God, when they come and tell the Lord in their prayers, that indeed he may condemne, or confound, or cut or caſt them off, he may continue to frown upon them, and to withdraw his ſpirit from them; he may deny ſuch and ſuch requeſts of theirs, for ſuch and ſuch juſt cauſes, in them; but what wil he gain thereby? he may gain many praiſes &amp;c. by hearing them, and helping them; but what good wil it doe him to ſee them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the enemies of their ſoules? or what delight would it be to him to ſee them ſighing, and ſinking, and fainting
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46945:255"/> under ſad preſſures &amp;c. this is an allowed, and a very ſuccesfull kind of pleading. We might inſtance in many other pleas reſpecting God, as that <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 15. <hi>Where is thy zeale, and thy ſtrength, the ſounding of thy bowels, and of thy mercies towards me? are they reſtrained?</hi> Theſe are prevailing pleas, ſince the Lord can as ſoon ceaſe to be, as ceaſe to be zealous of his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in his peoples welfare; ſince he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanteth power nor wil to help them in any needful caſe which concerneth them: for he hath ſtrength, and therefore is able, and bowels of compaſſion and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies, and therefore is willing to anſwer and ſuccour his people. Yea, every Attribute and Title of God, and every promiſe is a ſeveral plea, which God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſort of pleas reſpect the Saints themſelves which plead, and they <note place="margin">Pleas reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us:</note> are of two ſorts:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſome reſpect the dependency and needineſſe of our condition. <note place="margin">As our needi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as we are creatures.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, others the good of grace ſhining forth in us.</p>
                  <p>Of the former ſort let us inſtance in theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It may be, and hath been pleaded, that we are Gods creatures; both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as men, and as Saints by calling: we are the workmanſhip of his hands, and as ſuch plead for his gracious reſpects.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46945:255"/> 
                     <hi>Job</hi> 10. 9. <hi>Thou haſt made me as the clay, and wilt thou bring me to duſt again?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, thou haſt been at ſuch coſt and paines to make me, and now wilt thou altogether marre me by afflictions and temptations? ſo the Church pleadeth <hi>Eſay</hi> 64. 8, 9. <hi>But now thou art our Father: we are the clay, thou art the potter: be not wroth very ſore.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, Fathers doe not uſe to be irrevocably diſpleaſed with their children, nor wil they correct them without meaſure, or whip them to death. Potters doe not uſe to conceive ſo deep a diſtaſte againſt a poore veſſel of clay, as to rage againſt the ſame, without all reſpect to their own credit, or to their own workmanſhip: and therefore ſurely thou our heavenly Father and Potter canſt not, wilt not doe thus. Thus <hi>David</hi> pleads his Faſhioning by God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 73. <hi>Thy hands have made and faſhioned me, give me underſtanding, that I may learn thy Commandements.</hi> God himſelfe maketh it an argument to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, why he wil bear his people, <hi>Eſay</hi> 46. 3, 4. <hi>I have made, and I will beare: even I will carry, and will deliver you.</hi> And it is a prevailing reaſon with God, <hi>not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for ever, leſt the ſoule ſhould faile before me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and the ſpirit which I have made, Eſay</hi> 57. 16. ſo would God have this an argument to help the weakeſt faith, to expect its deſires above all its feares.
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:46945:256"/> 
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 43. 1, 2. <hi>But now thus ſaith the Lord, that created thee, O Jacob, and he that fr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thee, O Iſrael, Feare not.</hi> And ſo V. 7. <hi>For I have created him for my glory, I have formed him, yea I have made him.</hi> And therefore ſurely the Saints may wel urge this, in any like caſe, in prayer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may plead the imbecillity and <note place="margin">We are fraile creatures.</note> frailty of our natures. So <hi>Iob</hi> pleadeth for the ſpeeding of Gods manifeſting of his pardoning and reconciling grace to him. <hi>Iob</hi> 7. 21. <hi>Why doſt thou not pardon my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and take away mine iniquitie? for now ſhall I ſleep in the duſt, &amp;c.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Lord if ever thou intendeſt (as I am perſwaded thou doſt) to renew the former beams of thy favour, and pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mercy, thou hadſt not need to defer too long, leſt it come ſomewhat too late; for ere long I ſhall returne to my duſt. This is <hi>Davids</hi> plea in the like caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 12, 13. <hi>Keep not ſilence at my teares, for I am a ſtranger with thee. Spare me a little, that I may recover my ſtrength, before I goe hence, and be no more.</hi> So <hi>Iob</hi> pleadeth this, <hi>Iob</hi> 13. 25. <hi>Wilt thou break a leafe driven to and fro? and wilt thou purſue dry ſtubble?</hi> What credit it is to ſo great a Majeſty as thou art, to ſhew thy power againſt a poor leafe? or to runne after a poor leafe, which every puffe of wind whisketh hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thither? or is it any honour ſo much as to a man, to be cutting and
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:46945:256"/> hewing a poor leafe, which can make no reſiſtance? Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> pleadeth for Audience and patience in hearing him: becauſe he is but duſt and aſhes, of little ſubſtance, &amp; ſhort continuance before the Lord, if the Lord pleaſe now to heare him whilſt he is before him, he is not like to trouble him long; it is but a very little and he is gone: he is but weak, and it is not much diſcouragement in denial of requeſts, which he is able to beare. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 27. And the Lord hath ſanctified this plea, as an argument to himſelfe to ſhew his ſervants mercy. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 13, 14. <hi>He pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth thoſe that feare him; for he knoweth our frame, he remembreth that we are but duſt.</hi> So <hi>Eſay</hi> 57. 16. <hi>I will not contend for ever, for the ſpirit ſhould faile before me.</hi> This prevaileth with the Lord, not to charge too hard upon his poore people.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Plead we the extremities of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, <note place="margin">We are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities.</note> inward or outward: our extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being Gods opportunities of hearing and helping us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 16. <hi>Have mercy upon me, O Lord;</hi> why ſo? <hi>for I am deſolate.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. 7. <hi>Heare me ſpeedily, O Lord,</hi> why ſo? <hi>my ſpirit faileth.</hi> I have but a little ſpirit left, O Lord, to breath after thee, and ſpeak to thee, let me not ſpend that in waſte: Lord, my ſoule is dying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſpeak Lord, anſwer Lord, before I faint quite away. A gracious anſwer, Lord, would even fetch life in me again: and
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:46945:257"/> nothing elſe but that wil recover me: and therefore heare me ſpeedily, a poor dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſinking, fainting ſpirit, O Lord I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thee. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 12. <hi>Save me, O God, for the waters are come even to my ſoule: I ſinke in the deep mire, where is no ſtanding.</hi> This plea in effect is thus, Lord I am ready to drown; if ever thou wouldſt ſave a poor periſhing ſervant of thine, ſave me: my troubles and temptations are too deep for me, I am ready to ſinke over head and eares in them, and therefore Lord reach hither thy gracious hand, and beare up my head above water, leaſt otherwiſe I miſcarry: but eſpecially, if ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities continue, the continuance of them may be pleaded. Such is <hi>Hemans</hi> plea, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 88. 14, 15. <hi>Lord, why hideſt thou thy face from me? I am afflicted and ready to die, from my youth up, whilſt I ſuffer thy terrours I am diſtracted:</hi> and God maketh this an allowed plea to himſelfe, of ſhewing his people mercy in ſuch a caſe. <hi>Eſay</hi> 42. 19, 20. <hi>I have a long time holden my peace. Now will I deſtroy and devoure at once. And I will bring the blinde by a way they know not, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt the Angel uſeth this plea <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>O Lord of Hoſts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jeruſalem, againſt which thou haſt had indignation theſe threeſcore and ten yeers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Plead we our helpleſneſſe in our <note place="margin">We are help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les otherwiſe.</note> ſelves, and in any other beſides himſelfe.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46945:257"/> So Pſal. 22. 11. <hi>Be not far from me, for trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is neer: for there is none to help.</hi> So <hi>Ier.</hi> 14. 22. <hi>Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles, that can cauſe raine? or can the heavens give ſhowres? Art not thou he, O Lord our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou haſt made all theſe things.</hi> So 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>We have no might, we know not what to doe, but our eyes are unto thee.</hi> Either then thou muſt help, O Lord, at this dead lift, or elſe thine enemies will prevaile. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60. 11. <hi>Give us help againſt trouble, for vain is the help of man.</hi> When people are in a periſhing condition, it muſt not keep them from making out to God, but they muſt take this to bottom their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts upon for mercy; their ſpirituall oppreſſours and oppreſſions muſt make them repaire to the Lord, and that wil prevaile for ſuccour, from that great one the Lord Jeſus. <hi>They ſhall cry unto the Lord,</hi> (Eſay 19. 20.) <hi>becauſe of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, and he ſhall ſend them a Saviour, and a great one, and he ſhall deliver them.</hi> Pſal. 72. 12. It is engaged concerning Chriſt the true <hi>Solomon, He ſhall deliver the needy when he crieth, the poore alſo and him that hath no helper.</hi> He cannot forget the cry of his ſucking ſhiftleſſe babes, that hang upon the breaſt, and can no more ſhift for a living then a poore infant. God himſelfe urgeth his people to come to him, with this plea in their mouthes,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:46945:258"/> 
                     <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 2, 3. <hi>Take unto you words and ſay, Take away all iniquity, and receive us gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly. For in thee the fatherleſſe finde mercy:</hi> The like is done <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>Truly in vain is ſalvation hoped for from the hils: truly in the Lord our God is ſalvation.</hi> So is the Lord himſelfe moved hence to help his people. <hi>Eſay</hi> 63, 5. <hi>And I looked and there was none to help; and</hi> I <hi>wondred that there was none to uphold, therefore mine own arm brought ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to me.</hi> And Deut. 32. 36. <hi>The Lord ſhal repent for his ſervants, when he ſeeth their power is gone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5.

Hence alſo the Lord himſelfe when he would ſtir up himſelfe to choice acts of mercy to his poore people, he firſt aggravateth their ſin againſt him to the higheſt, and then expreſſeth his royall act of grace to them.

                     <hi>upon me, O Jacob, but haſt been weary of me, O Iſrael, thou haſt not honoured me with thy Sacrifices; but thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſinnes, and wearied me with thine iniquities: I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for my names ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The latter ſort of pleas, reſpecting our <note place="margin">The good of Gods grace, as Gods ſtirring us up to plead with him.</note> ſelves, or the good of grace in us, are</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Gods own ſtirring us up to pray for ſuch mercies. When a petitioner can plead with God, Lord, I come not to thy bleſſed Court without thy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for. It was thou which appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedſt me to come to thy doore of grace; elſe I had not come; thy Spirit moved me, thy promiſe encouraged me ſo to doe: and therefore, O Lord, I expect the fruit of my comming and requeſt. So <hi>David</hi> pleadeth 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 27, 28. Lord, thou ſaideſt this and that touching my houſe, and therefore hath thy ſervant found in his heart to pray this prayer. And ſo <hi>Pſalm</hi> 27. 7, 8. He pleadeth, <hi>Thou ſaideſt, ſeek my face; and my heart an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Thy face Lord will I ſeeke.</hi> And well may this be pleaded, in that God uſeth not ſo to ſtirre up, and ſtrengthen us to ſeek him, but when he intendeth to be found of us. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Thou wilt prepare the heart, thou wilt bow thine eare to heare.</hi> Jerem. 29. 11, 13. <hi>Then ſhall ye ſeek me, and finde me, when ye ſhall</hi>
                     <pb n="482" facs="tcp:46945:259"/> 
                     <hi>ſearch for me with all your heart.</hi> And God maketh it an argument to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that if he ſay to any inwardly as wel as outwardly, <hi>ſeek my face,</hi> he that ſpeaketh righteouſneſſe cannot ſpeak thus to them and fruſtrate their prayers, and ſo bid them ſeek his face in vain, <hi>Eſay</hi> 45. 19. <hi>I ſaid not to any of the ſeed of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, ſeek my face in vaine; I the Lord ſpeak right things.</hi> If <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> bid his Spouſe to ask, ſurely he wil not faile to grant her petition, <hi>Eſther</hi> 7. 1. ſo here. And as when Chriſt called the blind man to come to him to tell him his grievance, it was truly ſaid to him by them, <hi>Be of good comfort, riſe, for he calleth thee, Mark</hi> 10, 49. ſo it is in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our waitings, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations <note place="margin">Our waiting upon him.</note> of Faith which the Lord wrought in us, may be pleaded. That a King ſhould occaſion a petitioners ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of bounty, and faile him, were not ſeemly; it were ſtrange. Hence <hi>Aſahs</hi> plea, in his prayer for help, <hi>Help Lord;</hi> why ſo? <hi>for we reſt on thee,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. 11. So <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 66. <hi>Teach me good judgement and knowledge, for I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved thy Commandements.</hi> And <hi>Pſalm</hi> 25. 2, 3. <hi>My God I truſt in thee, let me not be confounded.</hi> And <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Lead me forth in thy truth, For on thee doe I wait all the day.</hi> And <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>Let me not be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for I truſt in thee.</hi> And <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>Let</hi>
                     <pb n="483" facs="tcp:46945:259"/> 
                     <hi>uprightneſſe preſerve me, for my hope is in thee.</hi> And <hi>Pſalm</hi> 143. 8. <hi>Let me heare thy loving kindneſſe in the morning, for in thee is my truſt.</hi> And it is an argument with men; ſuch a one doth depend upon me, and I have paſſed my word to doe ſuch or ſuch a thing for him, and he commeth to meet me, according to my own appointment, at ſuch a time, in expectation of what I promiſed; and therefore I cannot, may not, muſt not faile him. So it is with God, <hi>Eſay</hi> 26. 3. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee, becauſe he truſted in thee.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>The poore committeth himſelfe to thee. Thou art the helper of the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we may (in all humility) <note place="margin">The breaking of our hearts before him.</note> plead our heart-breakings and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in ſenſe of want of mercies which we crave, and our pantings and fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings after the ſame. As <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39. 12. <hi>Hold not thy peace at my tears.</hi> And <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. <hi>David,</hi> who groundeth all his pleas onely upon the free grace of the Lord, Verſ. 1. <hi>Have mercy upon me, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy loving kindneſse, &amp;c.</hi> yet <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. he pleadeth the brokenneſſe of his heart, <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a broken heart; a broken and a contrite ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, O Lord, thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi> It is a moving argument with a compaſſionate father, when his child craveth this or
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:46945:260"/> that with teares, from him, not then to deny him. In ſuch a caſe, a father wil be ready to ſay, alas my deare child, thou ſhalt not blubber thy cheekes any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; come, doe not thus mar thy face with weeping, thou ſhalt have what thou cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt: ſo doubtleſſe is it with the Lord towards his children. When <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſmites upon his thigh, is aſhamed, and even confounded, becauſe he bare the iniquity of his youth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 19. how this took with God we may perceive by what himſelfe replieth, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>Is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim my deare ſonne? is he a pleaſant child? for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I earneſtly remembred him ſtill: therefore my bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord.</hi> So <hi>Eſay</hi> 38. 5. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is bid to goe to weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and tell him from God, <hi>I have heard thy prayer, I have ſeen thy teares.</hi> As if he had ſaid to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Goe runne to yonder childe of mine, bid him not weep ſo ſore; tell him, he ſhall have his requeſt. So <hi>Pſalm</hi> 6. 8. <hi>The Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.</hi> And V. 9. <hi>The Lord hath heard my petition.</hi> His prayer and petition it ſelfe ſpake, and his tears alſo ſpake aloud in Gods ears, and prevailed for audience.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the integrity of our hearts <note place="margin">The integrity of our hearts and waies.</note> and waies, in former workings after God and ſervice for God, may by faith
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:46945:260"/> in Chriſt, as all in our juſtification, be alſo pleaded. <hi>Eſay</hi> 38. 3. <hi>Remember that I have walked before thee in ſincerity, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 71. 17, 18. <hi>O Lord, thou haſt taught me from my youth, and hitherto I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared thy wondrous works: Now alſo, when I am old and gray headed: O God, forſake me not.</hi> Pſalm 119. 10. <hi>With my whole heart have I ſought thee, O let me not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from thy Commandements.</hi> The Lord himſelfe maketh it to himſelfe a motive, to ſhew mercy to his people. <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 8. <hi>They are children that will not lye: ſo be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their deliverer, Jer.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>I remember thee, the kindneſse of thy youth, &amp;c.</hi> onely we muſt uſe this plea more rarely and ſparingly, in a ſelf-denying way, in faith in Chriſts righteouſneſſe, as made ours. The like alſo may be ſaid of our integrity with men, which in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as of reproach, ſlander, or injurious dealing from men, may be by way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, pleaded before the Lord. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 15. <hi>Know, O Lord, that for thy ſake I have ſuffered rebuke.</hi> Pſalm 26. 1. <hi>Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in mine inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, we may plead our ſufferings, <note place="margin">Our ſufferings.</note> eſpecially thoſe that are moſt directly and properly for God and his cauſe. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſufferings alſo may be pleaded, as <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 32, 33. <hi>Let not all the trouble ſeem little to thee, which hath come upon us.</hi>
                     <pb n="486" facs="tcp:46945:261"/> 
                     <hi>Howbeit thou art juſt in them. Pſalm</hi> 90. 15. <hi>Make us glad according to the daies wherein thou haſt afflicted us.</hi> But eſpecially plead thoſe which are undergone for the Lords ſake. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 44. 22, 23. <hi>For thy ſake are we killed all the day long. Awake, why ſleepeſt thou?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, our former experiences of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <note place="margin">Our former experiences.</note> in like caſes may be pleaded, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 15. <hi>Where is the ſounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies towards me? are they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained?</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, Lord, thou hadſt wont to be a compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate God, I have had experience in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conditions and caſes of thy bowels; how commeth it to paſſe that they are ſo ſhut up now? So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. 17, 18. <hi>Thou haſt taught me from my youth up, forſake me not now when I am old. Pſalm</hi> 61. 23. <hi>Lead me to the rock that is higher then I: For thou haſt been a ſhelter to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the great good which we might both get and doe, may be alſo pleaded: <note place="margin">The good that we might get and doe.</note> God put that plea in their mouthes, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 2. <hi>Take away iniquity, and receive us graciouſly:</hi> why ſo? <hi>ſo will we render the calves of our lips.</hi> And <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>We will no more ſay to the works of our hands, ye are our Gods. Pſalm</hi> 119. 33. <hi>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy Statutes, and I will keep it to the end.</hi> V. 34. <hi>Give me underſtanding, and I ſhall keep thy law.</hi> Pſal. 51. 12, 13. <hi>Reſtore to me the joy of thy ſalvation: Then will I</hi>
                     <pb n="487" facs="tcp:46945:261"/> 
                     <hi>teach ſinners thy way.</hi> And as the Saints may plead the good which they may do, if anſwered: ſo that good of inward quickning, encouragement, and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they may thereby receive, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 14. <hi>O ſatisfie us early with thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi> why ſo? <hi>ſo ſhall we rejoyce and be glad before thee all our daies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third ſort of pleas are thoſe reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Pleas reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others. As their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of a like help.</note> others: which are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Others experiences of the like mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in like caſes: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 132. <hi>Be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to me, as thou uſeſt to doe to thoſe that love thy name.</hi> Lord, doe not change thy wont, doe to me as thou haſt ever done to others in my caſe. Let not me be the firſt <hi>Anomalon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others diſcouragements, or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements <note place="margin">Their diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements or incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ours.</note> in ours. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 6. <hi>Let not them that wait on thee be aſhamed for my ſake.</hi> 29. <hi>Let thy ſalvation (O God) ſet me up on high:</hi> why ſo? <hi>verſ.</hi> 32. <hi>The humble ſhall ſee this and be glad.</hi> If thou heare me, others wil be encouraged; or if not, they wil be aſhamed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſubtle and malicious deſires of <note place="margin">Enemies plots and deſires.</note> ours and Gods enemies: Ah Lord, our miſeries ſnares, feares, ſtraits, temptations, and falls, they are that for which they plot and wait, and are ready to reproach us with; and therefore the rather tender our caſe. Thus may we plead, as others have done, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 11. <hi>Make my way plain,</hi>
                     <pb n="488" facs="tcp:46945:262"/> 
                     <hi>becauſe of my enemies,</hi> Pſ. 38. 16. <hi>I ſaid hear me leſt otherwiſe they rejoyce over me, Pſal.</hi> 39. 8. <hi>Deliver me from all my tranſgreſſions, make me not a reproach to the fooliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now touching the laſt thing propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, namely, the rules which we are to attend to in pleading in prayer, they are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Look that we plead in faith; yea, with ſome ſtrength of faith, acted ſuitably <note place="margin">Believingly.</note> to our pleas. <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Where are thy bowels towards me? Doubtleſſe thou are our Father: Why haſt thou hardned our hearts from thy fear?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Look that we doe it with holy skil, Improving thoſe promiſes or Attributes <note place="margin">Skilfully.</note> of God, which are moſt ſuitable to our preſent caſes, which are moſt ſtrongly ſpeaking, moſt apt to move, at leaſt our ſelves to believe, and ſuch as uſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile that way formerly. So did the Church, <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 15, 16, 17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Look we be ſubmiſſive in our pleas, and not inordinate, impatient, or diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered. <note place="margin">Submiſſively.</note> 
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſomewhat diſtempered in thoſe pleas, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 22, 23. <hi>Wherefore haſt thou evil-entreated this people? why haſt thou ſent me?</hi> and <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 12, 13, 15. <hi>Whence ſhould I have fleſh for ſo many? I am not able to beare the burden alone. If thou deale thus with me, kill me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Look that we be humble and ſelf-denying <note place="margin">Humbly.</note> therein, and come not to God to
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:46945:262"/> ſtand upon terms with him, or to chop Logick (as we ſay) with the holy one. <hi>Job</hi> was too blame herein, <hi>Iob</hi> 23. 4, 5. and ſo were they <hi>Eſay</hi> 58. 3. <hi>Wherefore have we faſted, and thou regardeſt it not?</hi> So <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 21. <hi>Have not we propheſied in thy name, and in thy name done wonderfull works?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Look that we be ſincere in our pleas, <note place="margin">Sincerely.</note> that there be nothing lurking with us, and too well approved by us, which may be counterpleaded againſt us, and that juſtly by our own conſciences. As Eſay 58. 3, 4. <hi>Behold ye faſt for ſtrife.</hi> So <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22, 23. <hi>Depart from me ye workers of iniquity.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. About ſtraitnings in Prayer, and their Cauſes, Cures, and Differences.</head>
                  <p>HAving ſpoken of ſundry caſes of Conſcience touching the inceſſant practice of this duty of prayer: we come now to ſpeak of the ſeventh Caſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable therein, namely, concerning ſtraightnings incident to the Saints in prayer: and therein we ſhall enquire of <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Quae. </seg>7</label> 
                     <note place="margin">About the Saints ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in prayer.</note> the Cauſes, and then of the cures, and then of the differences of theſe ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, incident to the Saints from that Judicial ſpeechleſneſſe of hypocrites and reprobates.</p>
                  <pb n="490" facs="tcp:46945:263"/>
                  <p> But firſt we ſhall premiſe and prove that the Saints may be ſtraitned, and have their mouthes in a manner ſhut up in prayer. This is too evident in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary experience; and it were moſt ſad, if ſuch as were ſometimes ſhut up that they cannot pray, yea and that ſome continuance of time, ſhould be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be therefore none of Gods called and choſen ones. <hi>Davids</hi> mouth was in this reſpect ſhut, and therefore he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth the Lord to open it for him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 15. And hence alſo <hi>Aſaph</hi> complaineth of his being ſpiritually ſhut up, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 4. <hi>I am ſo troubled that I cannot ſpeak.</hi> Hence even the Saints are deſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of priſoners, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61. 1. and whoſe experience doth not at ſome time or other ſeal to this? But come we to conſider things in the order as they were propounded: and firſt of the cauſes of ſuch ſtraitnings, and they are three; <note place="margin">Cauſes of ſtraitnings in prayer. 1. Gods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing and ſhutting up.</note> God, Satan, and our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God is a cauſe: he withdraweth his Spirit, the Authour and efficient of all all our liberty of ſpeech, or ſteps which reſpect the welfare of our ſoules, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 17. Hence called <hi>the free ſpirit,</hi> from the effect, becauſe it freeth us to ſpeak or doe any thing to or for God, which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us unto, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 12. <hi>David</hi> wanted, and in his own ſenſe had loſt this ſpirit, in ſuch like efficacies of it, and in the
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:46945:263"/> ſupporting influence thereof: yea the Lord ſometimes layeth ſome ſpiritual bonds upon ſome of his profeſſed people. Hence that complaint of the Church, <hi>Why haſt thou hardned our hearts, from thy feare?</hi> Iſai. 63. 17. She found her ſelfe clung up in the waies of God. The Lord which ſometimes opens the hearts and ſpirits of men, can and doth other times ſhut them up, ſo as none but himſelfe can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain open them. <hi>Revel.</hi> 37. <hi>He ſhutteth, and nono can open.</hi> Sometimes ſome of Gods own <hi>profeſſed people,</hi> which are not bound by any Church for ſins deſerving the ſame in the nature of them, but being hid from the eyes of men, they cannot ſentence the perſons guilty thereof: yea, but the Lord ordereth the matter ſo, that they goe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience-bound, and excommunicated by God for the ſame. So was <hi>David</hi> after his fall, and before his confeſſion of the ſame, which (as it is probable) was not til a good ſpace after, even after the birth of the child which he had adulterouſly begotten, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13, 14, 15. O how a Chriſtians ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is hampered at ſuch a time in and by the cords of his own ſin! how is he bound up in petition and confeſſion, having no liſt to pray; and when he is at prayer, no life or delight in it! If he come to pray, he hath little or nothing to ſay, his words ſtick in his teeth (as it were) his thoughts are not at liberty to attend his words, his
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:46945:264"/> affections are not ſtirring, he cannot get his heart to be affected. If he doe ſtrive, it is but as againſt the ſtream; he would fain weep ſometimes over his condition in his prayer, but cannot: he is often preſſed in ſpirit, to make his moan thus and thus to God; but when he commeth to it, his ſpirit is ſhackled, and he can but ſhake his chaines before the Lord: his faith was in a dead ſleep in his prayers, he cannot tell how to apprehend any thing of God or Chriſt, (in a manner) therein, but is in his own ſight like an Atheiſt: the promiſes which ſometimes have been a great ſupport unto him, now he is not able to ſee any thing in them, or to make any thing of them: his mind is full of hurries, but at no liberty to fix upon God or his Covenant, yea he is not free to deſire grace and redreſs, as formerly: his conſcience paſſeth by him whilſt he is upon his knees, and often upbraideth him with his ſin or ſins, but wil ſcarce afford him any friendly word of direction what courſe he ſhould now take to mend himſelfe. God ſeeth his ſervants ſometimes play the ſpend thrifts, and running into arrerages with him, and then he wil lay them under reſtraint for a time, till they doe humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſerious manner to him; or he taketh notice that they wax wanton, and begin to abuſe their inward freedome, or are not ſo thankfull for it; and in ſuch a

So any other feares occaſioned by ſin, which are not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly legal, yet they are in this ſenſe bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Saints ofttimes.

In this work, after the ſoul hath in vaine toyled it ſelfe, and made nothing of it, it gathereth to it ſelf diſcouragement, and hath no liſt to ſpeak any more in ſo Athieſtical a ſort as at ſuch a time it will be apt to conclude: whereby it cometh to paſſe that the wheels of the ſoul wanting the oyle of joy and delight, they ſtick and cannot bee readily turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. Such ſtraining of our ſtrings too high, doth but occaſion ſome cracking in them, and thereby our muſick is marred for that time; when our ſpirits are once nonpluſt, (as they will ſoon be in ſuch tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent mental diſcourſes of a ſubject paſt their comprehenſion or inquiſition) they then bluſh, and the ſhame thereof putteth them to ſilence, like ſome petitioner to a King, ſo taken up in ſpeaking to him with many circumlocutions touching his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, majeſty, greatneſſe and glory &amp;c. that hee hath forgot what hee came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and is not able to recover expreſſions of his requeſt: ſo is it here.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing propounded now cometh <note place="margin">Helps againſt ſtraitnings in prayer.</note> to conſideration, namely, the means of cure of ſuch ſtraitnings in prayer, and they are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Be wee ſenſibly apprehenſive of the ſad and evil plight of a ſpirit ſtraitned in
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:46945:268"/> prayer. Such priſoners which mourn in the <note place="margin">1 Senſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the evils of ſuch ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</note> ſenſe of their thraldome, and of their pent and confined condition, are in the ready way to liberty in all the wayes of God, and ſo in this of prayer. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 61. 1. <hi>A broken heart</hi> will break this deep ſilence: and to help our apprehenſions herein, conſider but how ſad it is to be tongue-tyed otherwiſe, <hi>Mark</hi> 7, 32, 34. The Lord Chriſt ſighs over it, and you ſee with what difficulty it is cured, <hi>ibid.</hi> Such are uſually as deafiſh in hearing the word as they are ſpiritually tongu-tyed, they are ſtraitned in hearing as well as praying diſpoſitions: the Saints are never more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in praying, then when their ſpirits are much ſtraitned, quickned, and inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <note place="margin">Evils of ſuch ſtraitnings.</note> in hearing; and ſo on the contrary, men that have ears but hear not, have not ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual uſe of their ears: they have mouths and ſpeak not, they have not the fruitfull uſe of their mouths in prayer; yea, ſuch a dumb diſtemper in prayer, is attended with ſpiritual lameneſſe, and halting in the wayes of God; in walking wherein they make little progreſſe. Hence is it that the Prophet propheſieth of ſpiritual dumbneſſe and lameneſſe to be cured at once, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 35.</p>
                  <p>6. How miſerable and uncomfortable is the caſe of a man otherwiſe dumb, every one will eaſily conceive; and truly this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual tongue-tyed condition far exceeds the miſery of that, as might be eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated. When a man which hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, is taken ſpeechleſſe, how ſad is it
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:46945:269"/> accounted in all that behold it, or heare of it? Alas ſaith one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heard you not of ſuch a ſad thing befallen ſuch a one? he hath loſt his ſpeech: if he could but expreſſe his mind, it would never grieve his friends ſo much; but alas, he is ſuddenly taken ſpeechleſſe; ſo might much more be ſaid of ſuch a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Hence a ſpeechleſſe condition is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon the unprepared gueſt, as a ſad <hi>Omen</hi> and fore-runner of his after doom. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 12. It was the next and firſt effect of divine wrath upon ſuch profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, and it is well if it be not the caſe of many that hear me this day. Ah, how ſad is it to hear ones tongue cut out? (as I may ſay:) nay, ſuppoſe it be but gagged by the enemies of our ſouls, like notorious theevs; firſt, robbing us of the treaſure of our peace, &amp; leaving us Conſcience wounded, and then gagging of us, leſt by our out-cryes unto heaven they ſhould ſoon be purſued and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached, and executed. O the weight ſuch poor ſoules feel! but know not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the ſame! they would faine crye, as men oppreſſed in their ſleep, and tell how ſad it is with them, but they cannot. What, to be thrown into a dungeon and to be in a manner forbidden all meanes to ſend to, or ſpeak with, either our heavenly father, or our elder brother, and chiefe tryed friend Jeſus Chriſt! How ſad is this? What, not to be ſo much as at priſon liberty, even to beg out of the very grate? This is moſt ſad:
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:46945:269"/> ſure wee are in for ſome great matter of fact, elſe wee ſhould not bee left under ſuch ſtraits. Begging is but a poor trade, you will ſay; yea, but whilſt we are at liberty to beg for our ſoules livelihood, it is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, it is hopefull; but when even that poor trade faileth us, verily all will yeild that this caſe is much to be lamented. O how muſt ſuch needs waſt and pine away, like that dumb perſon mentioned in the Goſpel? <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 17, 18. How will ſuch run upon deſperate adventures, like him that ſometimes caſteth himſelfe into the water, ſometimes into the fire, and what more contrary one unto the other? Yet verily, if not upheld, thus will theſe doe in that want of this free ſpirit: a free ſpirit it is an upholding ſpirit from all ſuch diſtempers. How unthankfully do ſuch walk, if their mouths be not opened? God hath little prayſe from them. <hi>Open thou my lips, and my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy prayſe. Pſal.</hi> 51. 15. Sad are their caſes all the while, all theſe ſweets are in their ſenſe, at leaſt in their experience reſtrained from them, whilſt their hearts are hardned, congealed, (as it were) ſhut up, faſt cloſed. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 15, 17. The Church which complaineth of her heart as hardned, complaineth likewiſe of Gods mercies as reſtrained from her: this black of a ſtraitned ſpirit will appeare the more, by comparing of it with the white of a free ſpirit, which is free in prayer, and
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:46945:270"/> other holy Duties. What <hi>David</hi> ſaid of his caſe is true in this, that it argueth that the Lord delighteth in us when hee delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth us ever and anon from this ſtraitned condition, and ſetteth us at a holy liberty in our ſpirits, the Lord delighteth in ſuch of his people, whom he admitteth and ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth to be ſo free in opening their minds and heart unto him; and as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 18. 32, 33. <hi>God girdeth mee with ſtrength, and maketh my way perfect, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth my feet like Hinds feet;</hi> ſo may we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the ſame to this caſe, that verily the Lord maketh our way perfect when there are no more ſuch blunders therein, and he communicateth ſpecial ſtrength to us, when we can more freely without ſuch ſtops, lets and abruptions, and reſtings, keep on in this part of our Chriſtian courſe and race; yea, and it is an Argument, that we ſhall by him be enabled to do great things when he thus enlargeth our ſteps; <hi>ibid. v</hi> 35, 36, 37. <hi>He ſetteth me on High places, and thou haſt enlarged my ſteps, &amp;c.</hi> And that the Lord hath known our ſouls in adverſity, he hath owned us, and ſo alſo will when in this wiſe alſo he ſetteth our feet in a large room <hi>Pſalm</hi> 3 1. 7 8. <hi>Thou haſt knowne my ſoul in adverſity; thou haſt ſet my feet in a large room.</hi> I have urged this the more to be ſo apprehenſive of the evil of this impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſpirits in prayer, if ever wee mean to get at liberty, becauſe there are
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:46945:270"/> a ſort of Spiritual Priſoners, whoſe hearts and ſpirits are ſhut up in prayer, and other holy Ordinances, and yet they lay it not to heart; or when they perceive and feel themſelves to begin a little to be reſtrained, they are but ſlightly affected with it; they think all is not well with them indeed, or ſo well as formerly, and wonder what is the matter that they are not ſo free and ſo much carryed out in prayer as heretofore, but it may be this is but nine dayes wonder to them, and ſo by degrees their ſpirits are ſtill more and more ſtraitned, and then they begin to have more ſerious troubles and fears about the ſame, what the iſſue thereof may prove; and ſometimes their fears are more deſperate, leſt the Lord hath thus laid them up, as intending ere long to proceed againſt them in a way of wrath and juſtice, and then they begin to beſtir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and make out for help. But if this ſtraitning continue long with them, then haply, as it is with priſoners, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at their firſt coming into priſon, it ſeemed ſomewhat ſtrange and ſad to them, which but then walked at liberty, to be thus cooped up, and they many times ſadly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan their caſe; yet having been long in priſon, then they begin to grow more reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and deſperate, and are leſs ſolicitous of uſing meanes to get out. So is it here with many Chriſtians; at firſt they are much troubled at their ſtraitnings in Prayer, but
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:46945:271"/> when they have been a long time ſhut up in their ſpirits, truly then they are apt to grow more deſperate, and ſecretly to think and conjecture, that there is little hope now, that they ſhould recover their former freedom of ſpirit: they have uſed ſuch and ſuch means, but all in vain, they ſeem but to ſtrive againſt the ſtreame in wreſtling in their poor meaſure with God and themſelves for their liberty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were as good even to be content and quiet, and ſo ſuffer their ſins like <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilahs</hi> to lull them aſleep, and to bind them in ſuch ſort, that their ſtrength departeth from them, and they are made a miſerable prey and reproach unto the enemies of their peace. So much of this firſt Means of cure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Plead it with God, that his Promiſe <note place="margin">2. Plead Gods Promiſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large us.</note> and Covenant is to inlarge us. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 9. If he will lead us with Supplications, then with multiplyed inlarged expreſſions of our hearts in Prayer; if with weepings too, then with inlarged affection alſo. For what God promiſed to them of old, hee is the ſame to make it good to us, as need requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>lead them with weeping and ſupplications in a ſtrait way wherein they ſhall not ſtumble.</hi> Yea, ſet we our faith on work; inforce ſuch ſutable Promiſes made to perſons even in their ſad plight, upon our owne hearts: let them ſhamefully give God the lye, If they doe,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:46945:271"/> if they dare to deny to expect freedom by vertue of the ſame. Since the Lord Jeſus is annoynted, appointed, and fitted of God for this very purpoſe, to ſpeak, and that effectuallly, liberty to the Captives indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely; ſurely then to ſuch poor ſouls as are ſpirit and heart-bound, groaning under, and mourning over the ſame as their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme miſery, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61. 1. God is verily faithful in his promiſe, to make the dumb to ſing and ſpeak forth his praiſe for Gods opening their mouthes, looſening their tongues in his Service, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 35. 6.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but will ſome poor ſoul ſay; I have given juſt cauſe of this my Impriſonment, I am in for debt and delinquencies, I am juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhibited and reſtrained my former free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſpirit, and therefore what have I to plead?</p>
                  <p>

<pb n="508" facs="tcp:46945:272"/> hampered, intangled, and bound up; yet he purpoſeth that he would conſtantly wait and expect, and look for his liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 11. <hi>My eyes are even unto the Lord, he ſhall pluck my feet out of the net.</hi> So do you; and albeit while you plead and urge your caſe before the Lord, and preſſe the ſame upon your own ſpirit, yet you ſeem to your ſelfe but hard and ſlight; as the Church whilſt and when pleading ſtrongly, yet cryeth out of her hardneſſe of heart, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Why haſt thou hardned our hearts from thy fear? &amp;c.</hi> yet ceaſe not to do it ſtill; and when at any time you doe get hold of any word of Grace, and grant of your liberty from the Lord, hold it faſt, and be not beaten out of the ſame by any cavils of the enemies of your peace. If when we go on in this, or any other way of God, we would not have our ſteps any more ſtraitned, take faſt hold of any <hi>item</hi> of Gods mind, of Grace; and if we once get ſuch a gracious Inſtruction and Information of Gods love in his Promiſe, ſet home by his ſpirit, then keep it, for the very life and livelihood of our ſouls depends thereon. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 12, 13. <hi>When thou goeſt, thy ſteps ſhall not be ſtraitned: Take hold of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, let her not go, keep her as thy life.</hi>

                  <p>The third thing propounded cometh <note place="margin">Differences betwixt others ſtraitnings and that of the Saints; which</note> now to be anſwered; namely, How this ſtraitning in prayer, incident to the Saints, may be diſcerned from that judiciary ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs mentioned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 12. <hi>He became ſpeechleſs.</hi> And from that ſad doom of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, whoſe gifts of prayer, and the like, come to be ſo miſerably diminiſhed, &amp; ſo far to decay, that they cannot pray in any ſort as formerly, their gift is in a manner taken from them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 12. <hi>From him ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away even that which he hath.</hi> To which I anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the ſtraitneſs incident to the Saints it is not perpetual; albeit they are kept a <note place="margin">1.

As <hi>David</hi> and others have been, and are. True it is, that ſome of the people of God may lye longer by it then others, and God may keep their feet in the ſtocks (as <hi>Jobs</hi> phraſe is, <hi>Job</hi> 13.) longer then others, for wiſe and holy ends; ſome again are ſhut up leſſe while, yet both the one and the other are
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:46945:275"/> inlarged at length. They for a time be bound asn iearth, ſo in heaven, like Excommunicants; but yet as that bound inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> was again looſed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 ſo is it with theſe. But it is otherwiſe with Reprobates and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites when Judiciary ſtraitning ſeiſeth upon them. Theſe chains of theirs are chains of darkneſſe, and in them are kept too, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bail or mainpriſe; Their ſtraitning groweth faſt upon them, until that after a while both their words, and will, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and all fail them in prayer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That is not total and univerſal as is <note place="margin">2 It is not total</note> the other. That ſpeechleſneſs in hypocrites is accompanied with binding hand and foot, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 12, 13. In all Ordinances as well as prayer, their ſpirits are ſhut up, and to no ſervice of God are they free; but the Saints when ſtraitned in prayer, yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes meet with ſome inlargement of heart in meditation, as the Church which found not God in publick or private Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. yet in reflecting Meditation upon what the Watch-men the Miniſters ſpake, therein ſhe found Chriſt. Sometimes in conference with other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians whilſt ſadly complaining of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted eſtate, even therein they meet with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The occaſion of that in the Saints, <note place="margin">3. Hath not the like occaſions; as, Reigning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</note> may be ſome particular defeat in them, or ſome particular diſtemper on their part. But the cauſe of this in the other is a total
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:46945:276"/> want of true Faith and Repentance; they have not that wedding garment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 11, 12. and hence become ſpeechleſſe, when called to an account for it. Or <note place="margin">Unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> ſome univerſal barrenneſs and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, as in the ſlothful ſervant that doth not at all, or to any purpoſe improve his Talent, and therefore it is taken from him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 18, 28. and <hi>chap.</hi> 13. 12. <hi>But from him that hath not ſhall be taken away that which he hath.</hi> Or it is occaſioned by ſome <note place="margin">Implacableneſs</note> high-handed contempt of reconciliation to ſome of Gods people whom they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, who thereupon commit their cauſe to God as the Judg of all; and God thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a Judg, delivereth them over to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual impriſonment, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 24, 25, 26. Or elſe it is occaſioned from ſome groſs, contemptuous, undervaluing, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy <note place="margin">Hard thoughts of God.</note> apprehenſions of God; as when the Hypocrite conceiveth God to be a moſt hard and unmerciful Maſter. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 24, 25, 28.

Or it may be ſuch a one <note place="margin">Reſting in gifts received.</note> doth wilfully reſt in ſome ſprinklings of gifts of grace received, without due care of continual ſupply for the future as well as for the preſent. They care not for a heart as well as a brain Treaſury, and ſo like fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh

                  <p>WE are (God willing) to diſpatch the handling of ſome other caſes, in carrying on this weighty duty of prayer.</p>
                  <p>The eighth caſe now to be conſidered of, is touching inlargements in prayer, how <note place="margin">Caſe. 8. About inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which are ſaving: when they are for the manner,</note> they are diſcerned to be from ſaving and peculiar principles of grace, and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from thoſe which are but from natural, carnal or common cauſes.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer whereunto, we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that perſons may be ſtrangely inlarged in prayer, ſometimes from principles that are not ſaving. The Phariſees made long praiers. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 14. But from a principle of hypocriſie, <hi>ibid.</hi> From carnal and ſinfull aymes. <hi>ibid.</hi> And for a pretence make long prayers. From pride, as in thoſe rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical ingeminations, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 7. from errour, as truſting to ſuch inlargements, thinking to bee heard for their much ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>ib. id</hi> And for thoſe in <hi>Iſ.</hi> 1 15. they made many prayers, or multiplied petitions, as the Hebrew phraſe imports: ſome from carnal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of ſome famous men in the Church will ſtraine this way; ſome from deluſive raptures, may be wonderfully inlarged in their expreſſions in prayer, yet none of theſe in the right.</p>
                  <p>Now ſaving inlargements in prayer
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:46945:278"/> may be diſcerned from thoſe that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</p>

                  <p n="2">2.

The Churches lips when exerciſed in prayer, as well as preaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> run downe like the beſt wine, cauſing the lips of thoſe that are aſleep to ſpeak.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. About Meltings in Prayer.</head>
                  <p>A Ninth Caſe is about Meltings in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>How they may be diſcerned to bee from ſaving principles, and not from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nature of ſome pathetical expreſſions in prayer, or from ſome common natural paſſion, or melting diſpoſition, and aptneſs of nature to tears.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This caſe is of weight, and its dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous being deceived herein, in the ſemblance of that which ordinarily faileth not of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God: yea never, when ſuch meltings in prayer are in truth. God eyed with a gracious aſpect <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> tears he ſhed in his prayers, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 5. and heard the voice of <hi>David</hi> weeping in his prayer. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
                  <p>Before we come to give a particular anſwer to this caſe, we muſt premiſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That God maketh uſe ſometimes of pathetical expreſſions to break his peoples
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:46945:281"/> hearts, when they are more hard, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, and ſleighty. And therefore often in the Prophets there is much uſe made thereof for the like purpoſe. <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> lamentations abound therewith: yea, the Lord maketh uſe of natural temper and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition this way, ſanctifying a natural, ſoft, tender, melting diſpoſition, as well as any other. 2 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 5. 17. <hi>All things become new.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 That yet it is very poſſible, that men may bee melted in prayer from ſuch common cauſe; ſome from meer natural tempers, ſome from carnal griefe, as thoſe grieved women whoſe husbands abuſing of them by marrying others in their life time, they made them cover the Altar of God with tears. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 13. Some from the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and moving nature of the notions in praier, (eſpecially praying with others) as notions pleaſing a curious fancy, or illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating their minds in material paſſages, or ſetting forth to the life ſome ſad afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter, &amp;c. Many of thoſe which with the reſt of the Congregation at <hi>Mizpeh</hi> wept abundantly at the religious exerciſes there, <hi>they even drew water,</hi> the text ſaith, 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 7. 5, 6. Verily, in many, this was from ſuch like common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, albeit in others it were from holy and ſpiritual cauſes; yea, ſome may from ſome ſudden extatical joyes conceived, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:46945:282"/> ſome miſtaken apprehenſions and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in prayer, as <hi>Benjamin wept for joy. Geneſis</hi> 45. 14. (which yet had a real ground in him,) ſo theſe from miſtaken grounds of joy.</p>
                  <p>But that we may come to ſome anſwer <note place="margin">When mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The Father of the poſſeſſed child in his requeſt unto Chriſt for its cure, had many more moving expreſſions <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 21. <hi>Ofttimes hee hath caſt him into the fire, &amp;c.

But the in gracious expreſſions he uſed in his prayer to Chriſt, <hi>verſe</hi> 24. <hi>Lord I believe, help mine unbeliefe.</hi> Therein he breaketh forth into tears.</p>

                     <hi>Davids</hi> teares (its likely) firſt ſpake, ere he uttered his heart; and his teares called out expreſſions, his expreſſions did not provoke and urge his teares. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. 8, 9. <hi>Jacob</hi> wept and prayed, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 4. he was weeping ripe, even as he went about to pray; his heart was ſo full, that it iſſued out at his eyes, before his mouth could utter forth his deſires and ayles.</p>

So in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> weeping with his prayers ſundry daies which he ſet apart for faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prayer for the calamities of the people of God in his native Countrey.

Think not of him under any likeneſſe or ſhape.</note> gave rules of worſhip to his people of old by voice; but in giving the ſame he repreſented no ſimilitude of himſelfe unto them: ſo are his people in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to perform obedience to thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of his without framing to themſelves either inwardly or outwardly any ſimilitude of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 12. &amp; 15. v. compared. In ſeeking the Lord we ought
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:46945:286"/> not ſo much as to think that the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head can be reſembled any way to any other thing, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 27. 29. verſes compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. This was one main riſe of Idolatry in practice, to make a mentall Idol of God; when men would not glorifie God, in worſhipping of him as ſuch a one as he made himſelfe known in his very works, even as an Almighty one, but would ſtrain to fancy things of him beyond his revealed wil, to ſeem to be men of a deep ſearch and reach, and of profound and exquiſite underſtandings and capacity: then did they vaniſh in ſuch imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons touching the nature of God, and were more and more dazeled and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and (in the juſt judgement of God) given up to miſ-ſhaped apprehenſions and idolatrous practices, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 21, 22. All things without God are finite, &amp; too ſhort a portraiture of an infinite Majeſty. In all compariſons there muſt be ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and equality: Now, unleſſe we could equal God to any thing, how can he be likened to it? <hi>Eſay</hi> 40. 18, 25.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Look that we doe not goe about to <note place="margin">2. Prie not too far into his Deity.</note> comprehend in our minds his glorious Eſſence, prying too far into his Majeſty, and the like: his Godhead is one of the inviſible things of God, and muſt no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be reached after by our ſhallow and dark minds, then as ſhining forth in the works and word of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. If we
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:46945:286"/> goe any further, we ſhall become vaine in our imaginations, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. Who can by ſearch finde out the Almighty to perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <hi>Iob</hi> 11. 7, 8, 12. we ſhould ſhew our ſelves in affecting ſuch wiſdome to be but vain men. Ibid. <hi>Iacob</hi> when he was at prayer, was a little too buſie herein, and too inquiſitive after the name or nature of the Son, or Angel of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is rebuked for asking his name: yet his weakneſſe is paſſed over, and the Lord bleſſed him notwithſtanding, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 29, 30. But rather in our approaches unto God, conceive we of him in his back parts, in his glorious Attributes: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him as one not to be fully conceived by us, and ſo pray to him with ſuch apprehenſions of him. <hi>Moſes</hi> did deſire in prayer to have God to ſhew him his glory: his inviſible being and Majeſty was too much for him to ask, or to have anſwered: God telleth him, he could not ſee his glory and live; mans finite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danding and ſpirit would be ſwallowed up, and confounded therein, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 18, 20. but his goodneſſe, and name of grace, his back parts are fitter objects for <hi>Moſes</hi> to contemplate upon, and to behold, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. 25, compared with Chap. 34. 5, 6: When God came down to his people that they might worſhip him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 11. he came down in a Cloud, that their prying eyes or ſpirits might be bounded: the Altar
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:46945:287"/> of Incenſe, where the Incenſe of prayer was to be offered, was before the Vaile that was by the Arke of the teſtimony, before the Mercy ſeat, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 6. God would have his ſervants to behold and mind him in their prayers; but yet his Mercy ſeat was covered with Cherubs wings, they might not prie too far: and indeed it is but an endleſſe work; we may weary our ſelves in this maze of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, but make nothing of our work when we have done. It is a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe bootleſſe work, no good commeth of it, but amazement and diſcouragement: we ſhall but reflect upon our ſelves as if we were very Atheiſts: conceiving and believing nothing at all of God, when we goe about to conceive more of him then is meet. When at any time the Saints of God, out of a witty kind of reaſoning of their deceitfull hearts, perſwading that it is meet that we ſhould conceive of God, to whom we pray, and the like, (which is in a ſenſe true) doe lance out in their ſlender skiffs or Canows into this vaſt Ocean, without the Cord and Compaſſe of the Scriptures: now if any guſt of temptation ariſe (as twenty to one but it doth) how are they amazed and affrighted, and know not where they are, nor how to get ſafe aſhore again, having forgotten the work they intended at the firſt? and commonly the work and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:46945:287"/> of prayer is for that time diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and left undone, or as good, being never at ſuch a time performed to any purpoſe. Beſides, the advantage we give to the enemy of peace and truth hereby, which is great; and if no worſe thing fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, yet we get a check from God for our labour, as <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32. 29. and <hi>Manoah,</hi> are reproved for asking after the name of that Angel the Son of God, which was ſecret, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 13. 17, 18. <hi>Why askeſt thou after my name, ſince it is ſecret?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conceive not God abſolutely, as out <note place="margin">3. Think of him relatively as ſuch or ſuch a one to thee in Chriſt.</note> of Chriſt, but as in Chriſt, and ſo merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, gracious, and abundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and truth. We muſt look, as they of old, to the glory of God, in offering up our ſpirituall Incenſe; but as in Chriſt, conſidered as Mediator, who is that Mercy ſeat; for ſo the Hebrew <hi>Capporeth,</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated uſually by the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> by the word <hi>Hilaſterion,</hi> and approved by the Holy ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 5. which in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. is applied to Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth to be <hi>Hilaſterion,</hi> the mercy ſeat, or mercifull Covering, or propitiation for our ſins; or that <hi>Capporeth,</hi> to which Gods Prieſts muſt look when offering their Incenſe of prayer, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 6. &amp; 25. 20, 21, 22. compared. We are not taught in the Lords prayer to look at, or think of God abſolutely, but relatively, as a father; namely, in Chriſt. Our thoughts
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:46945:288"/> of God muſt be ſuitable to our worſhip of him in prayer; which is a comming to God not immediately, nor abſolutely conſidered, but in and by Chriſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>Which eome to God by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let us not too much beat our thoughts about particular and perſonall appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of God, or conclude that we are <note place="margin">4. Goe not too far in perſonal thoughts of God.</note> Atheiſts in defect thereof: but be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in conceiving and believing that of him, that he is, and that he is a rewarder of ſuch as ſeek him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. with ſuch other generall apprehenſions, which ſerve to keep the heart humble, awfull and attentive: namely, that he to whom we pray, is ſuch a God, which ſeeth and knoweth all our ſecrets, our thoughts, wants, and ſins, and the like: that he is ſuch an one that is with us whereever we are; and that we are in him, and live by him; that he obſerveth what, and in what manner we do any ſervice before him, that he is a very holy God; that he is ſuch a one which comprehendeth us, albeit we cannot ſo fully comprehend him; and that therein lieth our bliſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 6. and ſo throughout the Pſalm: &amp; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 20. &amp; <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 27, 28, 29. Fix we our minds ſomtimes upon God under one, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under another of ſuch like notions touching him; and let the aw and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of God, either as one that is moſt holy, or that is moſt wiſe, or that is moſt
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:46945:288"/> mighty, carry us as far along as the Lord helpeth, and then conſider of him under ſome one or other like notion; and in our prayers carry that along in our minds as far as we can; and if our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits wax flat, or ſlight notwithſtanding, try them with thoughts of God under ſome other notion, as before mentioned.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Look that we limit not God to our <note place="margin">5. Limit not God to our conceivings.</note> ſhallow comprehenſions of him; but in all our thoughts of him, conceive of God as infinitely above all our conceivings: as <hi>Agur</hi> did, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 1, 2, 3, 4. yet conceive of him to be one that is ready, yea who is engaged to teach us to conceive and know him; <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 11. and to doe for us above what we are able to ask or think of him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 18, 19, 20.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Let us with wiſdome proportion out <note place="margin">6. Think of him ſuitably to our needs of him.</note> our conceivings of God, under ſuch a notion of his name and nature revealed in his word, as is moſt ſuitable to that which we are about in prayer. When God had proclaimed divers Attributes and Branches of his Name, <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not goe about to fill his mouth or his mind with them all at once, but ſelecteth out of them all, ſuch a one as is moſt ſuitable to the requeſt he hath hereupon to make for himſelfe, and for <hi>Iſrael;</hi> which was, that <hi>God would pardon their iniquity, Exod.</hi> 24. 8, 9. which was ſuitable to one of the laſt mentioned Branches of the name of his
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:46945:289"/> grace, namely, that be was <hi>one forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion, and ſin,</hi> Verſ. 7. and the like courſe doth hetake in that prayer of his mentioned <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 17, 18, 19, 20. We are to glorifie God in prayer thus, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what we know of him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. eſpecially to improve that of Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which he hath practically diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelfe to us; conceive of him as we have found of him by experience, and as we are convinced he hath carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe towards us: have we found the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his wiſdome? pray to him as one infinitely wiſe: have we taſted of the fruits of his faithfulneſſe? pray to him as ſuch a one, and that part of his Name wherein he hath laſt held himſelfe forth unto our hearts &amp; ſpirits, in a convincing manner; and with which we are laſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected moſt of all; worſhip him, and pray to him under that notion, but eſpecially conſider and conceive of him in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and precious demenſions of his love, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 18, 19. <hi>that we may comprehend with all Saints what is the height, and length, and bredth, and depth, and to know the love of Chriſt, which paſseth knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Let holy admiration ever and anon <note place="margin">7.

                  <p>THe laſt Caſe briefly to be ſpoken unto, is, how, and in what order we are to divide our prayers to the perſons of the
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:46945:290"/> bleſſed Trinity? and whether we may not ſingle out any one of the perſons, to whom we may direct more immediately ſuch or ſuch a prayer.</p>
                  <p>This Caſe hath ſome more difficulty in it then the former, yet I wil endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to lay down the Anſwer thereunto, as briefly as I can in theſe following con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That in all parts of Divine worſhip, and ſo in this of prayer, the Trinity in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <note place="margin">1 So think of God in prayer as one in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, yet three in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: and ſo as three in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that he is but one in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</note> and Unity in Trinity is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped and reſpected; and therefore we are not ſo to fix our thoughts on God as one; but rather to have this meditation and thought attending, that this one God in Eſſence is in perſonal proprieties three ſubſiſtences, really diſtinct nor yet are we ſo to let our thoughts expatiate and feed themſelves in muſings upon the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perſons as diſtinct in perſonal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties, but ſtill with an attending ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of them as one in Eſſence, one Jehovah, one God and no more. He to whom the Scripture applyeth the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of begetting, he is Jehovah, God the Father, and not the Son, or the Holy Ghoſt, to whom that property in reference to the eternal begotten of God is never aſcribed: he to whom the Scripture gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the property of being the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſon of God; he is Jehovah, God the Son, and no other perſon: the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:46945:290"/> aſcribing that propriety of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the divine being, in a way of begetting to none other: and ſo he to whom the Scripture applyeth that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of proceeding, he and onely he is God the Holy Ghoſt: the Scripture ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to none other of the perſons that propriety of Communication of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine being in a way of proceeding, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were breathed forth from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and therefore is called his ſpirit, <hi>Nom.</hi> 8. 11. and from the Son; therefore is called the Sons Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. yet the ſame holy Scripture never mentions but one Jehovah, or any more then one God, even when it mentions him in perſonall diſtinctions three, yet Eſſentially but one, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5, 7. and no otherwiſe ſurely are we to worſhip him, or to conceive of him in our worſhip. Let the beams of the glorious Unity of the Deity lead us in worſhipping of, or praying unto God, to the conſideration of the bleſſed Trinity; and let the mention or Meditation of the Trinity of the perſons in our prayers lead us forthwith to this glorious Unity in the Deity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In our prayers fix not our eyes or <note place="margin">2 So think in prayer of ſome one Perſon in the Trinity as thereby to be led to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two.</note> mindes ſo upon one of the glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as not thereby to be led to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and conſideration of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or direct any prayer ſo to one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the bleſſed Trinity, as not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:46945:291"/> the other: The Father being in the Son, and the Son in the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt in them both: <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 10. we cannot look at one, and behold one by a ſpiritual eye, but we muſt eye the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and be led to the other, as our Saviour reaſoneth, to prove that if they had ſeen him, they muſt ſee his Father alſo, verſe 9, 10. compared: They which look at Chriſt as their Mediatour, muſt ſee and eye the Father, as giving of him ſo to be; yea and at the Holy Ghoſt as one who with the bleſſed Father ſent and conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his deſignment to that office, as the Lord Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 48. 16. <hi>and now the Lord God and his ſpirit hath ſent me:</hi> yea they muſt eye the Holy Ghoſt as that bleſſed ſpirit and more immediate effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, by whoſe power and grace they thus come to the Lord, and are enabled to pray to him, or look to him; we cannot look aright to the bleſſed Father, but we muſt look to him as it were through the bleſſed Son; neither can we look upon the Son but by the Spirit. As he ſaid in that caſe 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. ſo may l in this: If we worſhip God as our Father, with whom we have Union and Communion, we beleeve him to be ſo to us in his Son, and that this Union and Communion is effected by the Holy Ghoſt: ſo that if we worſhip God aright, we worſhip each perſon in the Trinity in any one perſon,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:46945:291"/> as Con-cauſes of our Sonſhip, and union with God the Father as firſt in order re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating and adopting of us, the Son as one in and by whom we are redeemed and reconciled, and for whoſe ſake we are accepted with God, and expect to be heard; the holy Ghoſt as the immediate efficient of and with the bleſſed Father and Son of our calling and adoption, &amp;c. and therefore is he called the ſpirit of Sonſhip, as the Greek word ſignifies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. ſee <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5, 6. and he by whom more immediatly we are enabled to pray to the Father in the name of his bleſſed Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. true it is that a Chriſtian may not in every particular petition or confeſſion, particularly and diſtinctly conſider of the other two perſons in that one perſon, to whom more properly he directeth his prayer, but yet he muſt in the general bent of his minde and ſpirit do it and intend it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That in order we are firſt to direct <note place="margin">3. Direct we our prayers to the Father as firſt in order of the perſons.</note> our prayers to the bleſſed Father; yet not as firſt or chiefe in honour and dignity above the other two (for even the Son who albeit as man and as Mediatour he be inferiour to the Father, <hi>John</hi> 14. 28. yet as God and as the Son of God he is equall with him: <hi>John</hi> 5. 18. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6. and the Son is to be honoured, as equal with the ſame honour as the Father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 23.) but as firſt in order of ſubſiſting;
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:46945:292"/> according as the Scripture in two places, where the order of the bleſſed perſons is ſet downe, the Father is firſt ſet downe in order of witneſſing, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. and in invocation and worſhip. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. as firſt in order to be mentioned and invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and as he is the firſt in order, who was diſpleaſed, and to whom we are firſt in order reconciled in Chriſt; and who is firſt in order pleaſed on him, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19, 20. yea who firſt in order among the perſons laid the foundation of our Redemption: <hi>ibid:</hi> and therefore to him is aſcribed the work of giving his Son, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. and of ſanctifying or annoynting and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Lord Chriſt to his Office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, (albeit, as was ſaid, the holy Ghoſt be not excluded, but included, as acting in the bleſſed work, <hi>Eſay</hi> 48. 16) ſo are we in that order to worſhip him and to breath after neereſt fellowſhip with him, through Chriſt by the help of his bleſſed ſpirit.</p>

<pb n="547" facs="tcp:46945:292"/> what as to the Father, in the general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of their ſpirits, do the Saints mind and eye the other two perſons, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them as joyntly worſhipped; and therefore in their Prefaces of prayer oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mention expreſly, that bleſſed God one in Eſſence, yet three in perſons, as he to whom they ſpeak, and in the cloſe they ſubſcribe glory to the bleſſed Father, Son, and Spirit, three perſons yet one God, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

It is ſuppoſed, that he on whom men call, he muſt be believed on, or elſe he cannot be called upon by any; and when the Apoſtle in the verſ. 13. mentions the Name of the Lord, as that which is called upon, he in verſ. 14. expoundeth it to be meant of the Lord himſelfe: to call upon the Lords Name, is to call upon himſelfe.</p>
